        "title": "Ford\u2019s Q2 earnings show a thriving trucks, commercial business with EVs playing catch up",
        "content": "Ford generated $45 billion in revenue in the second quarter, a 12% pop from the same period last year largely fueled by sales of gas-powered trucks like the new Ranger, SUVs and commercial vans.\nNotably, the automaker raised its full-year guidance for 2023 to between $11 billion and $12 billion in adjusted earnings. The company also expects adjusted free cash flow of between $6.5 billion and $7 billion. Ford had previously set a guidance for adjusted earnings to between $9 billion and $11 billion.\nFord noted that while uncertain economic environment and inflationary pressures still exist, it raised the guidance because of an improved supply chain, higher industry volumes, upside from the all-new Super Duty and lower commodity costs. Rival GM also raised its guidance for the year by $1 billion to\u00a0between $12 billion and $14 billion, before interest and taxes.\nFord\u2019s results, which beat Wall Street expectations, and its raised guidance helped push shares higher by more than 3% in after-market trading, before settling.\nFord\u2019s second-quarter results show a company still reliant on sales of its popular gas and hybrid vehicle as well as an expanding commercial business. Ford also appears to be gaining a little ground in the world of EVs.\nFord is a little over a year into a reorganization that split the company into\u00a0three business units: Ford Blue for gas and hybrid vehicles, Ford Model e for connected EVs and Ford Pro for its commercial products. The company now breaks its earnings into these three units.\nCEO Jim Farley has previously said 2023 would be a pivotal year for the automaker with the reorganization giving the 118-year-old Michigan company the speed of a startup that will ultimately turn its EV segment into a profit center.\nEVs: still a money loser\nFord\u2019s EV business is still far from that goal.\nThe segment reported revenue of $1.8 billion, a 39% increase from the same year-ago quarter. However, it also reported loss of $1.08 billion in adjusted earnings, which was steeper than analysts expected. The company also previously reported a 2.8% drop in EV sales in second quarter after pausing production at the Mexico factory that assembles the Ford Mustang Mach e.\nAnd those losses will continue. Ford forecast the EV segment will lose $4.5 billion for the full year.\n\u201cThe near-term pace of EV adoption will be a little slower than expected, which is going to benefit early movers like Ford,\u201d Farley said in a statement. \u201cEV customers are brand loyal and we\u2019re winning lots of them with our high-volume, first-generation products; we\u2019re making smart investments in capabilities and capacity around the world; and, while others are trying to catch up, we have clean-sheet, next-generation products in advanced development that will blow people away.\u201d\nFord said that it expects its EV business to reach a 600,000 run rate in 2024. Ultimately, the company is targeting a 2 million run rate by 2026.\nThe numbers\nFord generated $45 billion in revenue in the second quarter of 2023, up 12% from the $40.2 billion in revenue it reported in the same period last year.\nFord\u2019s net income (on a GAAP basis) was $1.9 billion for the second quarter. On an adjusted earnings before interest and taxes basis, Ford earned $3.8 billion in the second quarter (about 8.4% of revenue), essentially flat compared to the same period last year.\nOperating cash flow for the second quarter jumped to $5 billion and adjusted free cash flow was $2.9 billion. Ford closed out the quarter with nearly $30 billion in cash on hand.\nCommercial wins\nThe big winner was Ford\u2019s commercial, or Ford Pro, business segment, which reported revenue a 22% quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue to $15.6 billion. The segment had $2.4 billion in adjusted earnings, double its profitability from a year ago.\nThat revenue jump isn\u2019t just do to sales of trucks, although the new Super Duty Work Truck did help. Sales of services and software also contributed to the bottom line. Ford Pro accounts for more than 80% of the company\u2019s nearly 550,000 paid software and services subscribers, to date, including solutions for fleet management, telematics and EV charging, according to the automaker.\n",

        "content": "Universe, the no-code mobile website builder, announced today that it\u2019s launching an AI-powered website designer in beta. The designer, called GUS (Generative Universe Sites), can help anyone build and launch a custom website from their iOS device.\nOnce you get started with GUS, you will enter the familiar Universe grid editor. Instead of starting with a template, you start a text conversation with GUS to begin creating your website. GUS will start by asking: \u201cWhat kind of website would you like to build today?\u201d Once you give GUS some initial details about the type of website you would like to build, GUS will ask you for a bit of information about what exactly you\u2019re looking. For instance, GUS may ask if you have a specific design or color scheme in mind, or if you have an idea of how many pages you would like on the website.\nAfter you give GUS details about your vision for the website, GUS will create a layout for you. The layout is completely editable, as you can manually change things without having to touch any bits of code. For instance, if you want to change an image that GUS selected, you can go in and swap it with a different one. Once you\u2019re happy with what you see, you can go ahead and publish your website.\n\u201cWhen we set out to develop what would ultimately become Universe, our mission was clear \u2013 to empower anyone to build the internet,\u201d said Universe founder and CEO Joseph Cohen in a statement. \u201cGenerative AI lets us do this at an entirely new level: just tell GUS what\u2019s in your mind and it\u2019ll build it for you. Now, everyone on our iOS app can try the GUS beta. We hope we can give everyone the confidence and design support\u2014from tattoo artists to general contractors to students to pragmatists to visionaries\u2014to claim their corner of the internet with the computer they already carry around in their pocket every day.\u201d\n\nThe GUS Beta is currently available to all users who update their Universe app on iOS. Universe plans to bring the experience to the web in the near future to give users without an iPhone or those who prefer desktop the ability to access GUS.\nUniverse\u2019s new tool is similar to one launched by Wix earlier this month, which is called the\u00a0AI Site Generator. The tool\u00a0allows users to describe their intent and generate a website complete with a homepage, inner pages and text and images \u2014 as well as business-specific sections for events, bookings and more.\nOne of the main ideas behind both companies\u2019 products is to help small and medium-sized businesses launch and maintain websites to drive sales, which can be a challenging process. For context, a 2022 survey\u00a0by Top Design Firms, a directory for finding creative agencies, found that nearly 27% of small businesses still don\u2019t have a website and that low traffic, followed by adding \u201cadvanced\u201d functionalities and cost, are the top challenges they face with their website.\nOf course, the products aren\u2019t only geared and marketed towards business-owners, as they can be used by anyone to create a website easily.\n\u201cUniverse continues to champion inclusivity and accessibility in web design, and GUS marks a significant milestone in this journey,\u201d Universe wrote in a press release. \u201cWith its AI-powered capabilities, GUS opens doors for individuals from all walks of life to bring their creative visions to life on the digital canvas.\u201d\nFounded in 2014, Universe has raised $47.3 million in funding to date, according to Crunchbase. The company raised $30 million in December 2021 as part of its Series B round from Google Ventures, Javelin Venture Partners, Box Group and more. Universe closed a $10 million Series A from Google Ventures back in April 2020.\n",

        "title": "Are you going to let Sam Altman\u2019s crypto project scan your eyeballs or not?",
        "content": "Welcome back to Chain Reaction.\nTo get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important crypto stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday at 12 p.m. PT, subscribe here.\nEarlier this week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman\u2019s audacious eyeball-scanning crypto startup Tools for Humanity started the global rollout of its Worldcoin product. The company wants to help build a reliable solution for \u201cdistinguishing humans from AI online,\u201d enable \u201cglobal democratic processes\u201d and \u201cdrastically increase economic opportunity\u201d the company said in a release.\nThe startup, which raised about $250 million altogether from backers like Andreessen Horowitz, Khosla Ventures and Reid Hoffman, said it\u2019s rolling out its identity technology as well as its token internationally.\nThe project gives eligible participants 25 Worldcoin (WLD) tokens, currently worth about $55, for onboarding. During its trial phase, more than 2 million people signed up and scanned their eyes for the startup\u2019s biometric database.\nWith that said, not everyone is excited about this endeavor and find the 25 tokens a nominal tradeoff for some of their biological data. Some people are also arguing that Worldcoin is exploitative for initially recruiting participants through poorer countries.\nIn an interview with MIT Technology Review, Worldcoin CEO Alex Blania acknowledged there was some \u201cfriction,\u201d with the startup, but attributed it to the fact that the company was still in its early phases.\nThe \u201cOrb tour\u201d began in Tokyo in April 2023 and has spread to other locations across North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.\nAlthough the Worldcoin token is not available to U.S. citizens due to regulatory restrictions, that hasn\u2019t stopped the startup from advertising appointments to get your eyeballs scanned in major American cities like Miami, New York City and San Francisco. I even spotted a few advertisements this week as I walked through mid and lower Manhattan, but did not make an appointment.\nIndividuals who participate must consent to the startup\u2019s biometric data collection. The consent form has three options: don\u2019t agree to anything (no data collected and no scan happens), agree to Orb scan but opt out of data custody (data collected, but temporarily stored) or agree to Orb scan and full data custody.\nWorldcoin\u2019s services are also not eligible to people in 11 other countries, including Ukraine, Russia, Iran and Cuba, as well as the European Union, according to its user terms and conditions.\nIf Worldcoin succeeds, there\u2019s potential for the startup to have one of the largest databases of human biometrics, which could come with security risks if the information is not protected properly. In turn, that data could help prove who is real online \u2014 and on the blockchain \u2014 a non-trivial problem to solve.\nOn the other hand, if the startup doesn\u2019t gain mass adoption, it could leave investors with a big hole in their pockets, and could make those who signed up susceptible to their personal information being sold to others (which is apparently already happening).\nWith all that said, would you sign up?\nThis week in web3\n\nWormhole digs out of its hole with new security measures to move on from $320M hack\nAvalanche Foundation to invest $50M in asset tokenization on its blockchain\nAfter federal court win, Ripple\u2019s legal head still expects the battle for regulatory clarity to drag on\na16z-backed Eco unveils Beam, a P2P crypto transfer service aiming to be a \u2018global Venmo\u2019\nCrypto wallet Zengo launches pro subscription with additional security features\n\nThe latest pod\n\nFor this week\u2019s episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Deana Burke and Natasha Hoskins, the co-founders of Boys Club.\nBoys Club is a social decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for the \u201ccrypto curious.\u201d Originally designed to get women and non-binary people into the web3 world, it now aims to be an open space for anyone looking to get into the space.\nAlthough it\u2019s a social DAO, Boys Club has a handful of other ventures, like their newsletter and podcast, which I was a guest on, as well as events like crypto conference parties and trivia nights.\nBefore Boys Club, Deana and Natasha were co-founders of a recently acquired travel platform Allcall. Deana was also a communications partner for the blockchain-based Celo Foundation and Natasha previously worked at Fora Travel as a general manager.\nWe discussed the origin story for Boys Club, what trends Deana and Natasha are following and how they\u2019ve seen the industry evolve since launching their group.\nWe also talked about:\n\nEthCC 2023 vibe check\nInclusivity in web3\nDiversifying the industry\nAdvice for the crypto newbies\n\nThe bonus pod\nThis week we also have a bonus episode.

        "content": "There\u2019s a pervasive myth in Silicon Valley: Startups are only founded by a bunch of 20-year-olds who recently dropped out of college. \u201cThe Social Network,\u201d \u201cPirates of Silicon Valley,\u201d the various Steve Jobs biopics, and even the \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d TV show \u2014 wherever you look, the popular narrative is all about youngsters making it big.\nIt is true that entrepreneurial folks are more likely to start companies before the real world has beaten the optimism out of them and dulled their eyes with cynicism. But while youthful vigor can fuel and motivate fresh-faced founders, startup veterans know there are other aspects of building companies that are equally important.\nAfter you\u2019ve seen enough startup pitches (God knows, I have), you start to spot a pattern: The best founders often have a few miles under their belt. The advantage is in having a curated, personal database of solvable problems, of the people who might be able to help, and a good idea of who you can sell your product to once you\u2019ve built it.\nLife skills often come with age. For example, having kids makes you a better manager, because it forces you to learn priorities and the value of time. Parents tend to be more resilient and patient, which are both crucial startup skills. But the real reason why experience is important is related to building one\u2019s personal network.\nWhen I got my journalism degree, I found myself wondering, \u201cGreat! Now I have the academic and theoretical context for the field of journalism, and I know all the techniques journalists use to string an article together.\u201d What I didn\u2019t have, though, was anything to write about.",

        "title": "FAA launches new committee to explore regulations on commercial human spaceflight",
        "content": "The Federal Aviation Administration is launching a new initiative exploring possible regulations on commercial human spaceflight, a first for a nascent industry that is rapidly increasing the number of humans that visit space.\nThe new rulemaking committee will \u201chelp the FAA plan, conceive, and implement\u2014when the time is right\u2014a well-informed, thoughtful, regulatory regime for commercial human spaceflight occupant safety,\u201d the FAA said in a statement.\nThe committee will gather recommendations from major stakeholders, which will no doubt include companies that operate human spaceflight services, including Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, and SpaceX, and submit them to the FAA next summer.\nWhile the committee is a step toward regulations, the FAA does not have any rulemaking authority over this aspect of human spaceflight in itself. Indeed, while the FAA has authority over launch as it relates to the safety of people on the ground, it is prohibited by federal law from regulating occupant safety on board launch vehicles, save in the case of death or serious injury. Instead, the FAA simply requires that crewmembers be made away of the risks and hazards of spaceflight and sign an extensive \u201cinformed consent\u201d form.\nFor the FAA\u2019s authority to change, Congress would need to act \u2013 and it appears that they might, and soon. Lawmakers placed a moratorium on commercial human spaceflight regulations in 2004, with the idea being that regulations could kneecap an industry that was only barely getting on its feet. Congress has extended that moratorium, sometimes called a \u201clearning period,\u201d twice \u2013 but unless they extend it again, it is set to expire this October.\nSome think the moratorium should be further extended. At a recent House Science Committee Hearing, Karina Drees, president of the industry group Commercial Spaceflight Federation, told lawmakers that establishing regulations now would be premature.\n\u201c[The] FAA does not yet have the expertise, resources, or plan needed to implement a revised occupant safety regulatory framework,\u201d she said. \u201cAllowing the learning period to end this year would open the door to regulations that inadvertently freeze development before industry has had time to mature, harming safety in the long-term and our nation\u2019s competitiveness.\u201d\nOn the other side of the issue, a report issued earlier this year by the RAND Corporation suggested that it was time for the moratorium to expire, even if the commercial human spaceflight industry was still in the early stages. One reason the researchers gave is that commercial spaceflight companies are not required to share safety data publicly, so there\u2019s a real lack of transparency regarding incidents and anomalies, and no real way for companies to learn from each other.\n\u201cThe current practice of nondisclosure and siloing of data and information may result in gaps or blind spots that could increase the likelihood of a catastrophic event,\u201d RAND researchers Douglas Ligor and Josh Becker said.\n",

        "title": "It\u2019s not just Netflix\u2019s $900K AI jobs, it\u2019s the hypocrisy",
        "content": "The discovery of an AI product manager role at Netflix with a pay ceiling of $900,000 sent critics of the company and entertainment industry wild yesterday. That isn\u2019t the only such listing, and likely not even the most lucrative. No one should be surprised that one of the biggest tech companies in the world is paying top dollar for machine learning talent \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean striking writers and actors shouldn\u2019t call out the hypocrisy on display.\nSo what are these jobs? In addition to the overall product manager one, there are five other roles with obvious machine learning responsibilities and likely more if you were to scour the requirements and duties of others.\nAn engineering manager in member satisfaction ML \u2014 their recommendation engine, probably \u2014 could earn as much as $849K, but the floor for the \u201cmarket range\u201d is $449K. That\u2019s where the conversation starts! An L6 research scientist in ML could earn $390K to $900K, and the technical director of their ML R&D tech lab would make $450K-650K. There are some L5 software engineer and research scientist positions open for a more modest $100K-$700K.\nOne comparison that was quickly made is to the average SAG member, who earns less than $30K from acting per year. Superficially, Netflix paying half a million to its AI researchers so that they can obsolete the actors and writers altogether is the kind of Evil Corp move we have all come to expect. But that\u2019s not quite what\u2019s happening here.\n\nMaybe showing off an AI-generated fake TV episode during a writers\u2019 strike is a bad idea\n\nWhile I have no doubt that Netflix is screwing over its talent in numerous ways, just like every other big studio, streaming platform, and production company, it\u2019s important for those on the side of labor to ensure complaints have a sound basis \u2014 or they\u2019ll be dismissed from the negotiating table.\nThe fact is that Netflix is among the largest and most successful tech companies in the world. While it is a novelty to have its name listed in the power acronym FAANG as well as next to megastudios like Disney and Universal, it also means that it must fulfill two sets of responsibilities.\nAs a tech company, Netflix is, like every other company on Earth, exploring the capabilities of AI. As you may have guessed from the billions of dollars being invested in this sector, it\u2019s full of promise in a lot of ways that aren\u2019t actually connected to the controversial generative models for art, voice, and writing, which for the most part have yet to demonstrate real value.\nNo doubt they are exploring those things too, but most companies remain extremely skeptical of generative AI for a lot of reasons. If you read the actual job descriptions, you\u2019ll see that none actually pertain to content creation:\n-You will lead requirements, design, and implementation of Metaflow product improvements\u2026\n-You will lead a team of experts in these techniques to understand how members experience titles, and how that changes their long-term assessment of their satisfaction with the Netflix service.\n-\u2026incubate and prototype concepts with the intent to eventually build a complete team to ship something new that could change the games industry and reach player audiences in new ways, as well as influencing adoption of AI technologies and tooling that are likely to level up our practices.\n-\u2026we are venturing further into exciting new innovations in personalization, discovery, experimentation, backend operations, and more, all driven by research at the frontiers of ML\n-\u2026Collect feedback and understand user needs from ML/AI practitioners and application engineers across Netflix, deriving product requirements and sizing their importance to then prioritize areas of investment.\n-We are looking for an Applied Machine Learning Scientist to develop algorithms that power high quality localization at scale\u2026\nSure, the last one is likely generative dubbing, or perhaps improved subtitle translation. And this doesn\u2019t mean Netflix isn\u2019t working on generative stuff too. But these are the jobs we\u2019re actually seeing advertised, and most are generic \u201cwe want to see what we can do with AI to make stuff better and more efficient.\u201d\nAI applies across countless domains, as we chronicle in our regular roundup of research. A couple weeks ago it helped find new Nasca lines! But it\u2019s also used in image processing, noise reduction, motion capture, network traffic flow, and datacenter power monitoring, all of which are relevant to a company like Netflix. Any company of this size that is not investing hundreds of millions in AI research is going to be left behind. If Disney or Max develops a compression algorithm that halves the bandwidth needed for good 4K video, or cracks the recommendation code, that\u2019s a huge advantage.\n\nAdobe\u2019s Scott Belsky talks generative AI \u2014 and why it\u2019s not going to end up like web3\n\nSo, why am I out here defending a giant corporation that clearly should be paying its writers and actors more?\nBecause if the unions and their supporters are going to take Netflix to task, as they should given the deplorable state of residuals and IP ownership, they can\u2019t base their outrage on industry standard practices that are necessary for a tech company to succeed in the current era.\nWe don\u2019t have to like that AI researchers are being paid half a million while an actress from a hit show a couple years back gets a check for $35. But this portion of Netflix\u2019s inequity is, honestly, out of their control. They\u2019re doing what is required of them there. Ask around: anyone with serious experience in machine learning and running an outfit is among the most sought-after people in the world right now. Their salaries are grossly inflated, yes \u2014 they\u2019re the A-listers of tech right now, and this is their moment.\nThe problem is that by Netflix demonstrating its ability to do what\u2019s needed in one area, they call attention to their failure to do what is required of them elsewhere \u2014 namely in support of creators, whose entire relationship with distribution platforms needs to be rewritten from scratch.\nThe threat of creators jumping ship and going to another streaming platform is very real. The next big indie horror hit is probably already working with A24 instead of one of the big guys because A24 gave the union everything they asked for. That\u2019s 50 million dollars in the debit column because someone didn\u2019t come to the table.\nBy all means let\u2019s get up in arms about inequity \u2014 but if this anger is to take effect, it needs to be grounded in reality and targeted properly. Hiring an AI researcher for an extravagant salary to refine their recommendation engine isn\u2019t the problem on its own \u2014 it\u2019s the hypocrisy demonstrated by Netflix (and every other company doing this, probably all of them) showing that it is willing to pay some people what they\u2019re worth, and other people as little as they can get away with. That\u2019s a deliberate choice, and one that the striking creators hopefully can ensure is no longer possible in the future.\n",

Cruise will also begin testing in multiple, new cities, according to the company. If the company\u2019s careers page provides any hints, it seems Atlanta is one of them.\nA year ago, the company only operated in San Francisco. Cruise has since expanded to Austin, Dallas, Houston, Phoenix and most recently Miami.\nCruise isn\u2019t commercially operating in all of these cities just yet. Cruise has a established a formula for its rollouts. The company typically enters a new market with test vehicles. Eventually, those vehicles will lose the human safety operator \u2014 making it driverless. A ride-hailing service will become available first to employees and then customers who have signed up for the service. The service area and hours often start on a limited basis and slowly expand.\n\n\nToday we are announcing Nashville \ud83c\udfb8as our next robotaxi-enabled city!\nYou\u2019ll see driverless @cruise AVs there in a few months.\nThis brings us from 1 city to 7 in about a year \u2013 and there are still more to come\u2026\nHere\u2019s how\ud83d\udc47(1/9)\n\u2014 Kyle Vogt (@kvogt) July 27, 2023\n\nToday, the company has commercial operations in San Francisco, Austin and Phoenix with one important caveat. Cruise still isn\u2019t charging for rides in San Francisco because it\u2019s awaiting a final permit from the California Public Utilities Commission.\nVogt said the company has been able to scale so quickly via its so-called city-first strategy, which starts with generalized tech and then tweaks the software to fit specific environments.\n\u201cWhat we had to do was find the areas where our AV system didn\u2019t generalize well and fix it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn some cases it was as simple as retraining our ML models using data from the new city. In some cases we found we had to redesign parts of a system.\u201d\nThis approach means each new city requires less work than the last, according to Cruise.\n",

        "content": "Personalized news app Artifact, developed by Instagram\u2019s founders, is adding another new AI-powered feature today. The company is launching an AI-powered text-to-speech feature in partnership with Speechify that will allow Artifact users to listen to news articles read aloud. The feature won\u2019t just offer a robotic-sounding voice as some other text-to-speech engines provide, but will instead introduce a variety of natural-sounding voices that can be customized by selecting different accents and audio speeds. Two celebrity voices \u2014 Snoop Dogg and Gwyneth Paltrow \u2014 are also available.\nTo access the new feature, Artifact users will tap the play button now at the bottom bar of any article. They can then select the voice, accent, and speed to start listening. From a slider, you can adjust the speed as slow as 0.1x to as fast as 4.5x, though most will opt for something more reasonable.\nThe app will allow you to continue to browse the news while the article you\u2019re listening to continues to play in the background. The company says this will make it easier to use Artifact to catch up on the news while you\u2019re working out, commuting, or doing chores, for example.\nAll of the 30+ voices are free to use and there\u2019s no plan to charge, Artifact notes. While they\u2019re only available in the English language for the time being, users can choose from accents like the U.K., Australia, Nigeria, and South Africa. Though Paltrow and Snoop Dogg are the only official celeb voices, there are other fun voices to choose from. For instance, one voice dubbed \u201cMr. President,\u201d sounds like Obama, while \u201cDwight\u201d is meant to resemble Dwight Schrute from \u201cThe Office.\u201d\nThe new voices are now one of many AI-powered additions that have arrived in the news app since its February 2023 public launch.\nLast month, the company announced it would also use AI to rewrite headlines of clickbait articles. When a user flags a title as clickbait, the app calls on a GPT-4 model to rewrite the headline. These rewrites are marked with a star icon to indicate they\u2019ve been changed from the original. And in April, the app began summarizing stories using AI, even letting people pick from fun styles like \u201cexplain like I\u2019m five,\u201d or even just a series of emojis, for a little whimsy.\nThe app\u2019s recommendation systems are also powered by AI technologies to surface content personalized to the end user, based on factors \u2014 like their clicks, reading time, dwell time, shares, and more \u2014 instead of just broadly what\u2019s popular across the user base.\nArtifact is similar in some ways to other news apps on the market,\u00a0including ByteDance\u2019s\u00a0Toutiao in China, Japan-based SmartNews, and News Break, another personalized news reader with Chinese roots. But in the U.S., it also faces steep competition from other sources where users get their news including the built-in news apps on smartphones provided by Apple and Google, and even social media sources, like TikTok.\nWith the addition of text-to-speech, Artifact will challenge other read-it-later apps like Pocket, Matter, and Instapaper, too.\nArtifact is well-liked by those who have tried it, sporting a 4.7-star review across 4.3K ratings on the U.S. App Store, but it\u2019s not yet blowing up to mainstream adoption, trailing the charts at No. 124 in the News category.\nThe new AI voices will roll out in an app update starting today.\n\nThe tech behind Artifact, the newly launched news aggregator from Instagram\u2019s co-founders\n\n",

The investigation, citing anonymous sources and industry experts, found that the directive to use algorithms to give rosier range numbers came from CEO Elon Musk.\nAs sales exploded, service requests also grew. To thwart the influx of requests and help keep costs in check, Tesla created a special \u201cdiversion team\u201d dedicated to handle so-called \u201crange cases\u201d \u2014 meaning owners complaining of lower ranges than expected.\nDiversion team members were trained to tell owners that the EPA-approved range estimates were just a prediction. They would also provide tips to customers on how to extend range. The end goal? To cancel those appointments, which would save the company as much as $1,000 a visit, the Reuters investigation found.\nIt should be noted that Reuters reported that it is unable to determine whether Tesla still uses algorithms that boost in-dash range estimates.\nTesla has been caught falsely advertising its range estimates before. As the report noted, South Korea regulators fined the Tesla earlier this year $2.1 million for falsely advertising driving ranges on its local website between August 2019 and December 2022. The Korea Fair Trade Commission also found that Tesla failed to inform owners that cold weather can reduce its cars\u2019 range. The commission cited tests showing Tesla cars lost up to 50.5% of the company\u2019s claimed ranges in cold weather.\nIn the U.S., Tesla has so far avoided fines by regulators. But since the 2020 model year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has required Tesla to reduce the range estimates the automaker wanted to use in advertising by an average of 3%.\nOne of the nagging problems with range estimates is their variability, which allows some automakers to push the boundaries of the system. While the EPA does review and approve those estimates, it allows automakers to use one of two methods to reach those figures: use a standard formula that converts fuel economy results, or conduct additional tests to come up with their own range estimate. Tesla has always done the latter, which gives far better numbers.\n",

        "content": "Surgeries of all kinds have become more and more powerfully assisted by technology, but in most cases it\u2019s still a human holding the scalpel \u2014 especially for delicate and complex operations like spinal surgery. Proprio\u2019s technology reinvents the way surgeons see, understand and influence the contours of bone and tissue, improving outcomes and potentially saving lives.\nThis isn\u2019t a compact X-ray machine or a cheaper MRI. It\u2019s a live aid to a surgery in which precision and accurate, up-to-date information about the patient is crucial. The promise of the technology has also attracted investment: the company today announced $43 million in new funding.\nSpinal deformation happens when a condition, trauma or habit causes the natural curvature of the spine to assume outsized or distorted proportions. The most frequent cause is probably scoliosis, which progressively warps the spine and if left untreated can lead to serious disability. To combat this, the spine is fitted with a custom metal frame, attached with screws, that restricts and corrects this tendency, shepherding the vertebrae into a more healthy arrangement.\nIt\u2019s not unlike getting braces \u2014 if teeth were sealed inside the body and there was a millimeter\u2019s breadth between curing and paralyzing the patient. Spinal corrective surgery is commonplace (about 1.6 million of this type are performed yearly) and effective, but it\u2019s also incredibly difficult and specialized work.\nAnd while new tools have emerged over the years to make it safer and more likely to succeed, a given procedure may still require a dozen X-rays and other scans, and the methods of virtually augmenting surgeons\u2019 own senses are stuck in the past.\nAn example of a scoliotic spine before and after corrective surgery. Image Credits: Proprio\nDetailed interior imagery is needed for prep, but by the time they\u2019re in the operating room, the images they have of the patient may be days or weeks old, and for acute conditions or trauma especially this is a huge problem. If the imagery doesn\u2019t match reality, not only could something have happened in the patient\u2019s body, but there\u2019s an increased risk of harm working with outdated info.\nIf the surgeon senses that the situation may have changed, the patient must be put inside an imaging machine and everyone must clear the room. Imagine doing that mid-surgery, with all that entails! Not only is it disruptive to the procedure and time-consuming, it leads to multiple radiation doses for the patient and the surgeon, who is repeatedly exposed to this process.\nFrom guessing to seeing\nA surgeon conducts an operation with a Proprio Paradigm device overhead. Image Credits: Proprio\nProprio is a startup that aims to completely change how this and other procedures are accomplished by, mapping detailed pre-operative scans to a real-time 3D representation of the patient\u2019s anatomy, running through a complex suite of sensors that monitor movements and changes at a sub-millimeter level.\nThe company\u2019s first product, Paradigm, is a real-time surgery guidance device comprising a complex multi-camera imager and a display that shows exactly what a surgeon needs to know in order to drive a screw down the exact trajectory necessary to attach the brace without splitting the vertebra or piercing the spinal cord and crippling the patient.\nTo do this, it performs a hyper-precise version of what your phone might do for an augmented reality app, which tracks the space and objects around you to place a virtual character or piece of furniture in the desired place. Though there are some systems that do something like this already, they rely on combining static, pre-operative imagery with a physical marker as a reference point. Essentially, they don\u2019t track the physiology of the patient, but rather the marker itself, meaning the position of the vertebrae, etc. \u2014 a confident guess rather than observed fact.\nIt also means if the person shifts, or the surgery is delayed, or for any other reason the imagery becomes out of date or misaligned, the systems cease to be effective \u2014 remember, being off by even a tiny amount is disastrous; neurosurgery isn\u2019t a discipline where people just eyeball it.\nProprio\u2019s device leapfrogs these methods through very, very precise imaging and computer vision. The \u201cPrism\u201d imaging array has half a dozen sensors in it, including multiple RGB cameras, infrared stereo cameras and a dedicated depth sensor.\nI visited the Proprio office in Seattle and saw a live simulated procedure and some development prototypes. CEO and co-founder Gabriel Jones and co-founder Jim Youngquist answered my various questions, though I did not take their answers down verbatim.\nPediatric neurosurgeon, co-founder and Chief Medical Officer Dr. Samuel Browd seemed genuinely excited and relieved by the promise of the tech; obviously it\u2019s his company, but it was clear to me that he considered his first duty to be to his patients, and thought of the Proprio approach as a long-awaited game-changer.\nExamples of real-time imagery during a simulated procedure. Image Credits: Proprio\nParadigm also works with pre-operative imagery, but not static images of the positions and orientations of vertebrae. Instead, the vertebra are rendered in 3D as the movable, dynamic objects they are, and the imaging unit can observe and \u201cregister\u201d their positions in real time, no marker necessary. (The company\u2019s \u201clight field\u201d talk may ring a bell \u2014 and indeed former Lytro engineer Thomas Nonn works on Paradigm.)\nSo if the patient moves, or needs to be moved, or for whatever reason the vertebrae are not exactly where they were when the MRI was taken\u2026 no problem. The system tracks them continuously in 3D space by minutely observing the exposed surfaces and other factors. While accuracy is not an easy metric to track down in such a variable context, the company did say it was at the \u201csub-millimeter\u201d level.\nHow this is done is part of the company\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 I saw several prototypes from their development process, with different numbers and configurations of cameras. The final design for Paradigm incorporates the best of those and is also, of course, all set up for work in an operating room.\nOR and beyond\nProprio in April received 510(k) clearance from the FDA, which is not a full green light exactly, but rather like saying you have an improved version of something already on the market that doesn\u2019t add any new risks. In this case it\u2019s devices for \u201cstereotaxic navigation for spine surgery,\u201d and the company \u201cperformed many usability and performance studies with everything from benchtop models to porcine samples and human cadavers.\u201d\nIts next step, then, is to commercialize the platform by putting it in as many operating rooms as possible and taking on its first in-human cases. That involves a lot of manufacturing, testing, training and support \u2014 few surgical aids are \u201cset it and forget it\u201d type devices. That said, they expect the first procedures to happen this summer at partnering hospitals.\nThe Proprio Paradigm device, and the door to the company\u2019s \u201cprecision lab.\u201d Image Credits: Proprio\nBut while spinal surgery navigation is the first and clearest application of the technology, it may well only be the company\u2019s opening move. There is, of course, the potential to apply the device\u2019s capabilities to other difficult surgeries \u2014 while it was built with spinal procedures in mind, the same method would be helpful in, say, joint reconstruction.\nYet even greater value might emerge from the inevitable \u201cdata play,\u201d though surgery is an area where such a play is desperately needed. Training new surgeons is a long and difficult process, and there is a distinct lack of rich data pertaining to any given procedure. There may be video, or not, of varying quality and recency. But high-fidelity collection and analysis of operations is less common than you\u2019d think, and what\u2019s out there is limited in other ways.\nThe Paradigm imager collects an enormous amount of data, which can be put to use in countless ways (of course all staying well within patient confidentiality laws and ethics). Training is an obvious one, but the team also showed how, by combining data from hundreds of previous surgeries and outcomes with real-time tracking of the patient, a prediction or projection of how a procedure might be improved. It may not be obvious even to an expert eye, but placement of a screw a millimeter over, or tightening a wire by a hair more, could be the difference between requiring a follow-up surgery or not.\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of tracking the surgeons and tools themselves; if complications occur, for instance, the procedure can be watched start to finish in high fidelity 3D, and the cause of the problems made clear in retrospect. And for the inevitable questions of insurance, malpractice and so on, it could also be used to show clearly that an instrument was used properly, or not used at all, or that it was this person and not that one who made a mistake.\nWhile these capabilities are notional right now (videos I was shown were mockups), they\u2019re certainly possible, but with a device like the Paradigm looking down on every surgery and producing an enormous body of data. While the concept may seem a bit repulsive from outside the OR, Dr. Browd seemed to think it would save many lives and make these procedures faster, better and cheaper.\nData-driven healthcare goes beyond electronic records and telehealth \u2014 and even robotic surgeries. There\u2019s room for technology to make many procedures better for both patient and surgeon, if the understandable reticence to part with tried-and-true methods can be overcome.\nThe company\u2019s $43 million B round came from new and existing investors DCVC, BOLD Capital Partners, Bird B. AG, Cota Capital, Intel and HTC.\n",

Ultimately, this has created a unique opportunity for emerging and legacy healthcare companies to build around pathways, leveraging new datasets, delivering novel reimbursement models, preparing for and complying with new transparency and interoperability legislation, and utilizing advanced AI to provide personalized understanding and delivery of information.\nData is the driver of pathway\u2019s success in clinical and operational settings\nIn the past, national guidelines dictated decisions made all the way down to the local level. Now, local, and even personalized, evidence-based pathways are driving decisions, thanks to the ability to access, create, and analyze new datasets.\nAccess to data, standardization of data rights, and the utilization of HIPAA-compliant collaboration tools, such as Datavant, will continue to improve compliance and create a more democratized, fine-tuned system of analysis for personalized pathways. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), under advisement from several healthcare companies, is now implementing an approved format for hospital charges as single machine readable files (MRFs), which will be leveraged to standardize all charge information.\n\n\n\t\t\tWith the ability to access, create and analyze new datasets, personalized, evidence-based pathways are driving more healthcare decisions.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThis will allow both large (national) and small (local) providers to access previously unavailable data that can then be used to enhance care coordination and delivery, promote quality improvement, advance research, and increase ROI.\nWe spoke with Eric Leroux and Dan Imler, emergency department MDs and the co-founders of clinical pathways startup Curbside, about the ability to utilize new data models in the transition from the national to the local level for clinical logic creation. They pointed out that while nationalized datasets have a role to play in insight generation, \u201cthe clinical and financial responsibility of point-of-care decision making is still inherently local\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0decisions must be governed there to have any real impact,\u201d especially in value-based care constructs.\nAs more companies like Curbside and AvoMD work to bridge the gap between art (no guidelines) and science (NCCN guidelines) when creating pathways, we expect more investment in startups that focus on the intersection of digital health and fintech as evidenced-based pathways and localized reimbursement engines become more necessary.\nReimbursement models\nPathways have evolved as a \u201ccornerstone of future reimbursement methodologies and quality efforts,\u201d as described by Dr. Robin Zon in ASCO Connection. They can help providers avoid \u201ctime-consuming prior authorization and appeals with payers,\u201d and capture \u201cstage and molecular data for a more refined risk adjustment.\u201d Today, clinical pathways can be used for reimbursement via a number of models, from value-based care (VBC) to legacy fee-for-service (FFS).\nFor example, CMS uses clinical pathways to create a benchmark for cost and quality in the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP). Providers who can provide care at a lower cost than the benchmark and who can meet certain quality standards are eligible for shared savings.",

The spec is expected to be finalized by the end of the year.\n\nApple and Google team up on industry spec to make Bluetooth tracking devices, like AirTag, safer\n\nAs a result of the increased cooperation on user safety, Google said at I/O in May it would introduce a series of improvements to its own Find My Device network as well as proactive alerts about trackers traveling with you, which would include support for Apple\u2019s AirTag and other devices. We understand this is a custom implementation to protect Android users, ahead of the finalized joint spec. Apple, however, will wait to implement the joint spec but will not roll out its own custom implementation in the meantime.\nAs this new alerts feature now rolls out, Android users will receive a notification on their device if an unknown tracker is separated from its owner and is determined to be with you. Users will then be able to tap on the notification to view a map of where the tracker was seen traveling with you.\nYou\u2019ll also be able to tap on \u201cPlay Sound\u201d to have the tracker make a noise, allowing you to locate the device.\nImage Credits: Google\nIf the device is found, users can bring it near the back of their phone to get more information. Some devices will share their serial number or additional information about the owner, like the last four digits of their phone number when held near the phone.\nYou\u2019ll also be presented with tips on how to disable the Bluetooth device completely so the owner can no longer track you and receive future updates from the tracker.\nIn addition, another feature will allow users to manually scan their surroundings if they\u2019re worried a Bluetooth tracker may be nearby. This manual scan can be kicked off by visiting Android\u2019s Settings, then \u201cSafety & Emergency\u201d and then choosing the option \u201cUnknown tracker alerts\u201d and tapping on the \u201cScan Now\u201d button. The device will take about 10 seconds to complete the manual scan and will provide tips on what to do next if a tracker is found. This way, users don\u2019t have to wait for an automatic alert.\nImage Credits: Google\nAlso announced at I/O 2023, Google said it would update its Find My Device network to help users locate other missing belongings, like headphones, phones and everyday items, like luggage and keys, which can be located by third-party Bluetooth tracker tags. It explained users would be able to locate devices by ringing them or viewing their location on a map \u2014 even if they\u2019re offline, adding that it would support trackers from Tile, Chipolo and Pebblebee, as well as audio devices like Pixel Buds and headphones from Sony and JBL.\nToday, however, Google says this update is on hold.\nThe decision was made to wait to roll out these updates because Google is now working in partnership with Apple to finalize the joint unwanted tracker alert specification by year-end.\n\u201cAt this time we\u2019ve made the decision to hold the rollout of the Find My Device network until Apple has implemented protections for iOS,\u201d Google says.\n\nGoogle updates Find My Device network, adds new feature to warn about unknown AirTags with you\n\n",

        "title": "Pet telehealth company Airvet closes on $18.2M to embark on enterprise focus",
        "content": "Pet ownership exploded during the global pandemic, and veterinarians are still struggling to keep up with demand.\nIn fact, a Mars Veterinary Health report from 2022 highlighted a need for more than 41,000 vets to enter the industry over the next decade in order to meet demand. Not enough people are going into this field, which means there will be an estimated shortage of 15,000 veterinarians by 2030.\nPet telehealth company Airvet is out to help them, buoyed by $18.2 million in new Series B funding. We last profiled the company in 2020 when it raised its $14 million Series A round.\nCEO Brandon Werber, whose father is well-known vet Dr. Jeff Werber, started the company in 2018 to connect pet parents with practicing veterinarians for telehealth visits any day, any time.\n\u201cThe vet shortage is going to make it very expensive and very, very difficult to get care for your pets when they\u2019re sick,\u201d Werber said. \u201cSo many vets today are not taking new clients at all. They\u2019re just telling you to go find another vet, go to an urgent care or an ER. The problem is most people can\u2019t afford impromptu trips to the vet. It\u2019s really expensive.\u201d\nHelp is on the way\nIndeed, with U.S. pet care estimated to grow from $118 billion in 2019 to $277 billion by 2030, all of this need provides an opportunity for technology to help.\nNot only has that attracted startups, but venture capitalists as well.\nCompanies like Digitail, Mixlab, The Vets and Dutch, to name a few, came on in recent years with solutions to help vets. Newer startups are coming in as well: Mascotte Health, a UAE-based veterinary service provider, announced $1.2 million in pre-seed funding this month, while Maven Pet recently raised $3 million to use AI to detect early onset of serious illnesses in dogs and cats, according to Guilherme Coelho, co-founder and CEO.\nHowever, even with the need for more veterinarian services, not every company\u2019s business model has succeeded. For example, Fuzzy, a company that created a digital pet care network of veterinary professionals, and raised $80 million in venture-backed funding since its founding in 2016, reportedly shut down in June.\n\nAirvet, a telehealth veterinary platform, just clawed its way to a $14 million Series A round\n\nThe enterprise route\nWatching what happened to Fuzzy, and trying to keep a company going amid a market shift, put things into perspective, Werber said.\n\u201cWhen the markets shifted, it put back into focus that you can\u2019t just build fast and recklessly,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to build with an eye and a path towards profitability, healthy margins, healthy unit economics and building a real scalable business. We had to take hard looks at our model and our strategy.\u201d\nBusiness approaches in the pet tech space run the gambit, but have largely focused on direct-to-consumer healthcare or helping veterinarians more easily manage their practices amid the demand.\nFor Airvet\u2019s part, Werber said he saw an opportunity to target business-to-business. The company has since built up a base of employer clients, including Adobe, Ceridian and Rexford Industrial, eager to offer an employer-sponsored benefit for employees with pets.\nWerber declined to go into specifics about customer or revenue growth, but said he expects Airvet to reach over 50 customers in the next year and that revenue was \u201cgrowing at a faster rate than before.\u201d\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s Series B round was led by Mountain Group Partners with participation from Canvas Ventures, Headline, Burst Capital and a group of strategic investors, including VCA Animal Hospitals founder Bob Antin. This gives Airvet just over $33 million in total funding. As part of the investment, Byron Smith, managing director at Mountain Group Partners, will join the company\u2019s board.\nThe funding will support the continued expansion of Airvet\u2019s partnership with enterprise and employer clients, on product development and to build out the company\u2019s sales and marketing teams.\n\u201cThe biggest plans for us now are to really build this category into a ubiquitous category for all employers and enterprises who want to acknowledge, support and celebrate pet families and provide services and resources for them in areas where they are really struggling,\u201d Werber said. \u201cA big part of that is access and affordability of pet care.\u201d\n\nDeal Dive: Caraway shows what else digital health can do\n\n",

        "content": "Many projects and companies would simply give up if they\u2019d been hacked and had hundreds of millions stolen from their ecosystem partners, but it appears Wormhole isn\u2019t one of them.\nLast year, an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Wormhole liquidity bridge between the Ethereum and Solana blockchains and stole about 120,000 wrapped ether, worth about $223 million today. A bridge, like the name suggests, facilitates transactions between different chains.\nShortly after the hack, Jump Crypto tweeted that it was replacing the massive chunk of ether stolen to \u201cmake community members whole\u201d because it saw Wormhole as \u201cessential infrastructure\u201d for the future\u2019s multichain world.\nAlmost a year and a half later, the cross-chain crypto bridging and messaging protocol seems intent on learning from its mistakes and making a comeback.\nSince the hack, the company\u00a0has stepped up its security, launched two $2.5 million bug bounty programs, and had a handful of third-party firms do a number of audits to resolve critical issues. The company has paid out several bounties, and by the end of the year, it plans to add three core contributing teams that will be \u201cbuilding in various capacities,\u201d Dan Reecer, head of operations at Wormhole Foundation, told TechCrunch+.\nThe company has finalized four teams so far and will potentially add one more, Reecer said. These teams will focus on building messaging protocols, zero-knowledge technology, business development, front-end tools, blockchain tools and more. \u201cIt\u2019s skill-dependent and we\u2019re bringing teams that have [these different] components,\u201d he said.\nWormhole also became one of two bridging protocols chosen by the Uniswap DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) for its cross-chain messaging after a study found the bridge fulfilled the necessary security requirements, according to Uniswap\u2019s Bridge Assessment Report.\nThe approval stems from the number of validators, including \u201creputable entities,\u201d as well as \u201csignificant improvements\u201d in response to its exploit in February 2022, the report added. However, the report identified some areas for improvement and \u201crecommends periodic monitoring for any material changes that may affect the protocol\u2019s security profile.\u201d\nSumming all that up: While Wormhole has indeed stepped up and improved its security around the protocol, there are still risks and concerns for its validators in the way the protocol bridges transfer messages and tokens.\nBut why did it take an exploit for Wormhole to ramp up its security efforts?\nReecer said he couldn\u2019t comment on why Wormhole didn\u2019t implement these measures before, as he joined the team only a few months ago, but he did note that security is always going to be one of the biggest priorities for the company.\n\u201cMaybe people didn\u2019t realize at the time [of the hack] how important this was,\u201d he added.\nBig efforts, small potatoes\n",

        "content": "Bluesky, which has been embattled with moderation issues since its launch earlier this year, appeared to apologize for failing to protect Black users and other marginalized groups on the platform.\u00a0\nIn emails responding to users who sent feedback regarding the platform\u2019s failure to moderate racist content, Bluesky\u2019s customer support outlined steps to address user concerns. The emails, which users shared on Bluesky, appear to be tailored to each individual user\u2019s feedback.\u00a0\nBluesky did not confirm that it sent apology emails to users who submitted complaints, nor did it respond to TechCrunch\u2019s request for comment about why the company apologized in private emails, but not in public statements.\u00a0\n\u201cSeems like each respondent is writing their own unique email, which is very weird because their information isn\u2019t quite consistent,\u201d journalist Erin Biba wrote in a post. \u201cAlso the language here is a lot stronger (it seems to me) than their public announcements.\u201d\u00a0\nIn the latest misstep, the platform failed to prevent users from using racial slurs in their account handles, drawing criticism from Bluesky users who were already frustrated with the rampant racism and anti-Blackness on the site. The backlash culminated in a \u201cposting strike,\u201d in which many users refused to engage with the platform until it established guardrails to flag slurs and other offensive terms in account usernames. The sitewide protest followed weeks of discontent from Bluesky users, who have been pushing the platform to crack down on hate speech and other violent threats against marginalized groups.\u00a0\nBluesky was also under fire for removing numerous racist, ableist and transphobic slurs from its list of flagged words in a contentious update following the backlash.\u00a0\nThe company then announced updates to its terms of service and community guidelines, which stated that Bluesky does not allow conduct that \u201ctargets people based on their race, gender, religion, ethnicity, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation.\u201d It did not respond to comments questioning whether the company would hire human staff to its trust and safety team, rather than rely on automated moderation.\u00a0\nIn a follow-up thread, Bluesky denounced racism and harassment on the platform, and vowed to prioritize moderation. The platform didn\u2019t issue a public apology to Black users and other marginalized communities \u2014 another sore point for many users.\u00a0\nBut in the emails responding to user feedback, Bluesky customer support explicitly apologized for the recent controversies on the platform. Users posted about receiving the emails throughout this week. Each email, however, contained different language and followed different templates.\u00a0\nIn an email sent to user Monica Rose, Bluesky customer support wrote that they \u201csincerely apologize for any offense caused by the presence of a user with a racist username on Bluesky.\u201d The email stated that Bluesky\u2019s moderation team is \u201cactively investigating the reported user and their username,\u201d and promised to take \u201cappropriate action\u201d to address the situation. The email, as Monica Rose pointed out, came about 10 days late \u2014 well after Bluesky publicly addressed the usernames with racial slurs.\u00a0\nThe emails, as Biba noted in her post, contain inconsistent statements about Bluesky\u2019s next steps. In the one she received, Bluesky customer support wrote that the company is \u201cactively considering the formation of a dedicated trust and safety team.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThis team will be responsible for implementing measures to prevent the use of offensive language, including slurs, and ensuring a safer space for all users,\u201d the email Biba received said.\u00a0\nOther emails took a firmer stance, and stated that Bluesky is establishing \u2014 not actively considering \u2014 a trust and safety team.\u00a0\n\u201cWe hear your demand loud and clear. We are in the process of building a dedicated Trust and Safety team to protect the experiences of marginalized users and ensure a safe environment for all on our network,\u201d Bluesky customer support wrote in an email to user voraciousviolet.\nThe email also stated that the platform will update its content filters, as well as develop \u201ceducational resources to raise awareness about the impact of racism and discrimination.\u201d\u00a0\nThe steps outlined in that email differ from the one sent to writer Joshua Friedman, which explicitly apologized for \u201cany impression that Bluesky has been perceived as hostile or indifferent to Black people and other minorities.\u201d In the email Friedman received, Bluesky customer support didn\u2019t mention a trust and safety team. Instead, the email vowed to implement \u201cimmediate and long-term solutions to combat racism, offensive behavior, and any forms of discrimination on Bluesky\u201d by strengthening moderation efforts.\u00a0\n\u201cWe recognize the importance of diverse perspectives in shaping our platform. We are actively working on fostering greater diversity within our management team to ensure a better understanding of the needs and concerns of all our users,\u201d the email sent to Friedman said. \u201cWe are committed to listening and engaging with our community, especially Black people, journalists, artists, academics, and other marginalized groups.\u201d\u00a0\nThe email sent to voraciousviolet also directly mentioned software engineer aliafonzy, also known as Aveta, who has been vocal about the anti-Blackness and hate speech on Bluesky. The email states that Bluesky is \u201ccommitted to issuing an apology to all affected users,\u201d including Aveta, for \u201cany harm caused\u201d by the company\u2019s \u201cfailure to implement adequate safety measures.\u201d\u00a0\nAveta, who declined to comment out of fear of further harassment on the platform, expressed skepticism. In a Bluesky post on Tuesday, she said Bluesky has not directly apologized to her.\u00a0\n\u201cBut it\u2019s a step in the right direction, I\u2019ll give it that,\u201d she posted. \n",

Instead, the company has primarily funded itself via Patreon, according to its founder and CEO Eugen Rochko. Now, that\u2019s changing as Mastodon on Wednesday announced its plan to sell merchandise to help raise more funds for its development efforts.\nThe new merch will include Mastodon t-shirts, mugs, enamel pins and stickers, created by artist Dopatwo. The merchandise itself will be manufactured by partner FRESH Merch using responsibly sourced materials, a Mastodon announcement explains.\n\u201cDespite our impressive accomplishments in building out the new social web, Mastodon is a non-profit with a very small team and limited resources\u2013the core team is just two developers,\u201d says Rochko, in the post. \u201c100% of the revenue after recouping manufacturing costs will go to us and help us put more resources into developing your favorite decentralized social media software.\u201d\nWhile many popular online creators and other celebs do well with online merch sales, it\u2019s unclear whether Mastodon\u2019s efforts will generate significant revenue. In an online poll, Mastodon said that over 6,700 respondents said they would buy something if merch was available. That\u2019s a promising start; however, Mastodon warns that only 250 units of each item will be available at launch, which puts a hard limit on how much funds it can raise through these efforts.

        "content": "Compared to streaming rivals, Peacock has been slow to spread its wings. The streaming service reported its second quarterly results on Thursday, revealing an addition of only two million subscribers, bringing its total to 24 million\u2014an increase of 9% compared to the 22 million from the previous quarter.\nWhen we look at competitors \u2014 like Netflix\u2019s significant gain of 5.9 million subs during the same quarter \u2014 Peacock is at the rear end of the flock. And although Disney+ lost four million subscribers in Q2 2023, its total continues to be astronomically ahead at 157.8 million. To be fair, Peacock nearly doubled its subscriber base from the year prior, when it had 13 million users, which is adequate growth for a three-year-old streamer. The recent incline in new users was mainly thanks to free customers converting into paying subs, according to the company.\nAs of January, Peacock no longer offers its free tier to new customers. Last month, Peacock stopped including its ad-supported plan, Peacock Premium, at no additional cost for Xfinity customers.\nAdditionally, Peacock revenue jumped 85% year to year to $820 million. However, the company also reported streaming losses. Peacock lost $651 million in Q2, compared to a loss of $704 million in Q1, and $467 million in the second quarter of 2022.\nWith this in mind, Comcast has a long way to go before its streaming business will be profitable. But we\u2019re curious to see how successful its slow and steady approach will be in the long run.\n\nNBCUniversal reports higher Peacock losses as it shows CEO the door\n\nLast week, Peacock notified existing customers that it\u2019s getting a price hike on August 17, marking the first time the streamer has increased its subscription prices since its\u00a02020 launch. Peacock\u2019s Premium plan will go from $4.99 to $5.99 per month, whereas the ad-free Premium Plus tier will get a $2 increase to come in at $11.99 per month.\nThe company believes that its content lineup is strong enough to justify the price increase. Peacock touts over 5,000 hours of live sports content, including Big Ten games, the Women\u2019s World Cup, Sunday Night Football, Premier League, as well as an exclusive NFL playoff game that will air next year.\nNotably, Comcast President Michael J. Cavanagh said during the earnings call that the company would consider looking at NBA rights.\n\u201cObviously the NBA\u2019s coming up, that\u2019s a fantastic property,\u201d Cavanagh said. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily need it, given the portfolio we have, but given its strength and our historical involvement in the sport, it\u2019s something I\u2019d like to see us take a look at.\u201d\nPeacock also touts its slate of original titles, such as \u201cPoker Face,\u201d \u201cMrs. Davis,\u201d \u201cThe Continental,\u201d \u201cBel-Air\u201d and \u201cBupkis,\u201d among many others.

        "content": "More tough times for the instant-delivery startups that once flooded the markets of Europe. Getir, the company backed by Sequoia and other big investors and once valued at upwards of $12 billion, today announced that it would be officially pulling out of Spain, Italy and Portugal as it inched closer to finalizing a round of investment.\nGetir also confirmed that it would continue to operate in the U.K., the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands and Turkey. The statement on the U.K. business puts to rest rumors that had been swirling that Getir was close to filing for bankruptcy protection (administration) in the country.\nGetir\u2019s retreat comes as it faces a major cash crisis and struggles to close a funding round that has been months in the works. The round was reportedly as high as about $500 million earlier this year, but that sum has reduced in recent weeks and will reportedly come at a big cost: rumors are that it could see Getir\u2019s valuation halved or more in the process.\nIt\u2019s not the only one: We\u2019ve confirmed with sources close to one of Getir\u2019s would-be rivals, Flink, that it raised $150 million a couple of months ago at a valuation of around $1 billion \u2014 only one-third of its previous $3 billion price tag. However, even under price pressure, Flink may have dodged a bullet: that fundraise came in the wake of the company walking away from acquisition talks with Getir.\nOne source alleges Getir is still burning through $100 million each month, one reason why the company may be trying to reduce its operational footprint.\nGetir said today that it will continue its operations in the U.K., U.S., Germany, the Netherlands and Turkey \u2014 which currently accounts for the majority (96%) of its revenues.\nThe company provided us with the following statement:\n\u201cGetir, the ultrafast grocery delivery pioneer, announced that it intends to withdraw in an orderly manner from Spain, Italy, and Portugal. At the same time, Getir is finalizing a funding round and will continue to operate in the UK, the US, Germany, the Netherlands, and Turkey, which generate 96% of the company\u2019s revenues,\u201d it said. \u201cGetir\u2019s withdrawal from these three markets will allow it to focus its financial resources on existing markets where the opportunities for operational profitability and sustainable growth are stronger. Getir is very grateful for the hard work and dedication of all its employees in Spain, Portugal and Italy.\u201d\nIt should be pointed out that there have been reports of Getir\u2019s move out of Spain since June, per union regulations; this is the official confirmation from Getir. The company had already pulled out of France in June.\nMubadala, the Abu Dhabi investment firm that already backs Getir (as well as others in the space, specifically Flink), confirmed to us this week that it will be leading Getir\u2019s next investment round, although it declined to discuss timing or any financials.\n\u201cMubadala has been an investor in Getir since 2021. We are currently in advanced discussions with Getir to lead their latest funding round and we continue to work closely with the company in support of its growth in the years ahead,\u201d a spokesperson said.\nA source tells us that the basis of the funding round is a $150 million loan that Mubadala provided to Getir at the start of this year. The source said that the loan was made on the condition that it would convert to equity if Getir was able to match the value with investments from others. If it failed to raise more funding from others, Mubadala\u2019s $150 million would double to a $300 million equity stake, so the pressure has been on Getir to get a deal done.\nSky News reported earlier in July that the aim was to finalise this round by the end of the month.\nGetir and its rivals have been on a rollercoaster ride over the last couple of years.\nThey soared to dizzying heights during and just after the pandemic as demand for food deliveries soared as people stayed away from physical stores, raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build out their footprints and aggressively quash each other in a mad rush of discounts and other promotions.\nBut it\u2019s been a quick downfall for quick commerce, as companies have come crashing down the rails in the wake of customers moving back into pre-pandemic shopping patterns, economies and individuals facing cash crunches, interest rising and venture funding drying up.\nAll of that has led to a big wave of layoffs, failures and consolidations in the space.\nAmong the biggest of them, at the end of last year, Getir gobbled up one of its biggest rivals in Europe, Berlin\u2019s Gorillas. It was on the cusp of taking out another biggie out of the German market, Doordash- and Mubadala-backed Flink, last valued at some $3 billion.\nFlink walked away from that deal, however, opting instead to raise $150 million on its own. Flink operates on a much smaller scale, but also a different one, in that its inventory is closely interlinked with that of one of its strategic investors, the German retailer REWE. That has given the startup better economies of scale. Now, Flink is profitable in half of its warehouses, a spokesperson said today, with the others on track to be profitable by the end of this year. (You can read more on Flink\u2019s approach here.)\nGopuff, another big player out of the U.S. market, has also made a number of waves in Europe, and it will be worth watching what moves it makes in the wake of all this.\nWe\u2019ll update this post as we learn more.\n",

        "content": "Esther Crawford, the former head of Twitter Blue, wrote a long post on X, the social network formerly known as Twitter, talking about the old management, working under Elon Musk and going viral for sleeping on the floor in the office.\nCrawford, who joined Twitter in 2020 after the company acquired her social startup Squad, said that the old management was often bureaucratic and you \u201cneeded to be a politician\u201d to get things done.\n\u201cAs someone with a maniacal sense of urgency built into me, Twitter often felt siloed and bureaucratic. Dumb power plays, reorgs and team name changes for the sake of someone\u2019s ego were distractions that occurred too regularly,\u201d she said.\n\u201cManagement had become bloated to accommodate career growth and the company culture felt too soft and entitled for my own taste. Healthy debate and criticism were replaced by a default refrain of \u2018no, that can\u2019t be done\u2019 or \u2018Another team owns that so don\u2019t touch it.\u2019\u201d\nCrawford highlighted an incident saying that a teammate had to go through multiple levels of approval just to reach out to some creators. She said that experiences like this often burnt out people.\nShe also said that when Twitter was waiting for the Musk acquisition deal to be completed, the company leadership \u201chid behind lawyers and legal language\u201d to answer questions about the social network\u2019s future.\nWorking with Elon Musk\nThe former Twitter exec said that she was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about Twitter when Musk took over. Crawford added that she sensed the Tesla CEO was going to make some smart and some stupid decisions.\n\u201cI made peace with the fact that I didn\u2019t have psychological safety at Twitter 2.0 and that meant I could be fired at any moment, and for no reason at all. I watched it happen repeatedly and saw how negatively it impacted team morale. Although I couldn\u2019t change the situation I did my best to shine a light on folks who were doing important work while being an emotionally supportive leader for those who were struggling to adapt to the more brutalist and hardcore culture,\u201d Crawford said.\n\u201cIn person, Elon is oddly charming and he\u2019s genuinely funny. He also has personality quirks like telling the same stories and jokes over and over. The challenge is his personality and demeanor can turn on a dime going from excited to angry. Since it was hard to read what mood he might be in and what his reaction would be to any given thing, people quickly became afraid of being called into meetings or having to share negative news with him.\u201d\nThe former Squad CEO said that Musk was just following his gut instinct or trusted \u201crandom feedback\u201d more than people on the inside. She noted that Musk would ask for product advice from a friend and even his biographer (Walter Isaacson). Additionally, she said while his passion and storytelling ability is inspiring, Musk\u2019s lack of process and empathy is painful.\nCrawford said that Musk looked like a lonely person because he spent so much time working. Plus, he was surrounded by people who always agreed with him.\n\u201cLiving in an echo chamber is dangerous and being at the top makes a person even more susceptible to being surrounded by yes people when nearly everyone around you is on the payroll and somehow stands to benefit from being in your orbit. Figuring out how to keep \u2018better angels\u2019 around in the form of family, friends, and teammates is critical to staying on the rails and enduring intense ups and downs. Everyone needs to hear hard truths sometimes and if you fire all the people who speak up then the reality distortion field may just turn into a vortex,\u201d she wrote.\nSleeping in the office\nIn November, Crawford went viral when a co-worker tweeted a photo \u2014 which is now deleted \u2014 of her sleeping in the office. She quoted that photo by saying, \u201cWhen your team is pushing round the clock to make deadlines sometimes you #SleepWhereYouWork.\u201d This came up even at the time when she was laid off from the company in February.\nCrawford said that this simply happened because her team was trying to meet a tough deadline.\n\u201cThe real story is pretty simple. I was given a nearly impossible deadline for his first project and as the product lead, I would never ask anyone to do anything I wasn\u2019t willing to do myself. So I worked round the clock alongside an amazing team spanning many time zones, and we delivered it on schedule \u2013 truly against the odds. It was intense but also fun,\u201d she said.\nAbout the current situation of Twitter/X, Crawford said she wouldn\u2019t bet against Musk because he\u2019s smart and has \u201cenough money to make a lot of mistakes.\u201d\nHere is the full post.\n\n\nLike seemingly everyone on this app I have plenty of opinions about Twitter > X and figure now is a good time to open up a bit about my experience at the company.\nI tweeted for years into the void for the love of it like many of you, but after selling my startup to Twitter in\u2026 pic.twitter.com/bw7CHhk0Xg\n\u2014 Esther Crawford \u2728 (@esthercrawford) July 26, 2023\n\n",

        "content": "Adobe is building on Firefly, its family of generative AI models, with a feature in Photoshop that \u201cexpands images beyond their original bounds,\u201d as the company describes it.\nAptly called Generative Expand, the capability, available in the beta version of Photoshop, lets users expand and resize images by clicking and dragging the Crop tool, which expands the canvas. After clicking the \u201cGenerate\u201d button in Photoshop\u2019s contextual taskbar, Generative Expand fills the new white space with AI-generated content that blends in with the existing image.\n\u201cSuppose your subject is cut off, your image isn\u2019t in the aspect ratio you want or an object in focus is misaligned with other parts of the image,\u201d Adobe writes in a blog post shared with TechCrunch. \u201cYou can use Generative Expand to expand your canvas and get your image to look like anything you can imagine.\u201d\nGenerated content can be added to a canvas via Generative Expand with or without a text prompt. But when using a prompt, expanded images will include any content mentioned in the prompt.\nGenerated content is added as a new layer in Photoshop, allowing users to discard it if they deem it not up to snuff.\nAdobe says that it\u2019s implemented filters to prevent Generative Expand from generating toxic content \u2014 a notorious problem for generative art AI.\n\u201cWhen using a prompt with Generative Expand, filters are applied to text prompts to reduce the creation of images that may contain inappropriate content,\u201d a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \u201cFiltering is also enabled on the variations returned from the model in an attempt to catch inappropriate generated content and automatically hide that content from display \u2026 \u00a0Any Firefly-generated images are pre-processed for content that violates our terms of service, and violating content is removed from our prompts \u2014 or the prompt is blocked altogether.\u202f\u201d\nAn image before Generative Expand has been applied to it.

OpenAI has long offered an \u201cuncropping tool\u201d via DALL-E 2, its text-to-art AI model, as have platforms such as Midjourney and Stability AI\u2019s DreamStudio.\nBut native integration with Photoshop is clearly Adobe\u2019s play, here \u2014 and, given that Photoshop had an estimated 29 million members worldwide, it\u2019s a strategic one.\nIn one downside compared to the competition, Adobe notes that Generative Expand isn\u2019t yet available for commercial use. But that\u2019ll change in the second half of this year if all goes according to plan, the company says.\nAlongside Generative Expand, Adobe announced that it\u2019s bringing support for Photoshop\u2019s Firefly-powered text-to-image features \u2014 which the company claims have been used to generate more than 900 million images to date \u2014 to over 100 languages, including Arabic, Czech, Greek and Thai.

        "content": "The crypto payments space is seeing a surge of activity these days as developers strive to make decentralized finance as user-friendly as web2 experiences.\nEco Inc., an a16z-backed payments startup that\u2019s raised $95 million in funding to date, just unveiled a decentralized payments project called Beam. In an interview with TechCrunch, the company\u2019s CEO Andy Bromberg described Beam as a non-custodial payment system that functions like a \u201cglobal Venmo.\u201d\nThe wallet\u2019s non-custodial nature means that no centralized party, such as a bank or exchange, has access to users\u2019 funds. This is an increasingly attractive feature for consumers, especially after the FTX implosion. The wallet is not linked to one\u2019s identity, making it an ideal choice for those who want financial privacy.\nThe challenge facing many self-custodial wallets, according to Bromberg, is that they require users to be crypto-savvy. Beam\u2019s goal is to make decentralized wallets intuitive enough that even people new to crypto can be onboarded within minutes.\nTo begin using Beam, users need only visit the wallet\u2019s website, where a QR code linked to a wallet address is automatically generated. From there, they can transfer USDC stablecoins from their existing wallets or use the popular on-ramp service, Moonpay, to convert fiat into crypto.\nTo transfer funds to others, users can share a wallet URL that contains the cryptocurrencies. This means that the receiver doesn\u2019t need to already have a crypto wallet set up in order to receive the tokens.\nWhile these features may seem straightforward compared to the wide range of options available on Web 2.0 payment apps, the reality is that \u201cit\u2019s so much harder to do things decentralized,\u201d as Bromberg noted.\n\u201cThe promise of crypto is self-custody, decentralization, censorship resistance \u2014 all these things, and if you want to maintain those in a product, it adds all sorts of developer friction to build that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really proud of here is [Beam] is the closest I\u2019ve seen to a web2 experience.\u201d\nThe app is \u201cinstantly globally available,\u201d added Bromberg. Traditional financial products, in comparison, \u201cneed to be launched country by country because you have to be touching the banking rails in every country.\u201d\nBeam is not trying to compete with other wallets on the market, many of which tend to serve general purposes, like logging into decentralized apps, said the CEO. Rather, it\u2019s \u201cmore like a payments wallet built with guardrails.\u201d\n\u201cIt does a narrow set of things and only support certain tokens and certain interactions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it actually decreases the chance that people get scammed or defrauded.\u201d\nIn its early stage, Beam is targeting peer-to-peer payment scenarios and strives to eat into the global Venmo use case \u2014 especially in dollarized regions outside the U.S. Its more ambitious goal down the road is to become the global Visa.\nBlockchain\u2019s technical progress\nWith new technical upgrades emerging in the blockchain ecosystem every few months, Eco has had to stay on top of the constant development.\n\u201cI think literally until the last few months, it wasn\u2019t possible to build something that felt as seamless and easy as cash,\u201d said Bromberg. \u201cAnd now it is with account abstraction, roll-up development and new blockchains, that we\u2019ve built this really compelling, really easy wallet.\u201d\nSimply put, account abstraction allows developers to add new functionalities such as social recovery to wallets, eliminating the vexing 16-word seed phrase and improving the usability of self-hosted wallets. Account abstraction has been possible thanks to a new Ethereum standard, ERC-4337, which has given rise to a new class of wallets called \u201csmart contract wallets,\u201d which are programmable.\nBuilding on a smart contract, Beam has its access keys sharded into three places \u2014 one\u2019s Twitter account, a password they set up and their browser, any two of which can reconstruct the original key.\nThe issue with some smart contract wallets, according to Bromberg, is that they are serving crypto-native users. For instance, one needs to already own Ether in order to send USDC.\n\u201cThat\u2019s like saying, in order to send someone dollars, you need to have like Venezuelan currency in your wallet. It doesn\u2019t really make any sense for consumers,\u201d Bromberg suggested. Instead, Beam lets users pay a fixed fee in USDC when they transfer USDC.\nBeam is also replacing long, confusing wallet addresses with ENS domain names, which are decentralized identities running on Ethereum. Within Beam, users can create their own ENS names by paying with the native Eco tokens. Say I have registered \u201crita.beam.eco,\u201d and my name will simply be displayed as \u201crita\u201d on the platform.\nRoll-ups, or Layer 2 solutions, tackle another major challenge in crypto\u2019s usability. They lower gas fees (transaction fees) and increase a network\u2019s throughput by processing transactions off-chain and then submitting them to the main network in batches. Beam is powered by two of these Layer 2 methods, Optimism and Coinbase\u2019s Base.\nEco is building with a team of 45 employees across North and South America. Its previous investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase Ventures, Founders Fund, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Pantera Capital.\n\nBacked with $3M, Soul Wallet aims to bring self-hosted crypto wallets to the next billion\n\n",

If the latter, this would make the breach the largest breach of healthcare data this year \u2014 and the most significant data breach reported as a result of the MOVEit mass-hacks.\nMaximus has not confirmed which specific types of health data were accessed and has not responded to TechCrunch\u2019s questions. In its 8-K filing, the company said it began notifying impacted customers and federal and state regulators, adding that it expects the security incident to cost approximately $15 million to investigate and remediate.\u00a0\nClop, the Russia-linked data extortion group responsible for the MOVEit mass-hacks, claims to have stolen 169 gigabytes of data from Maximus, which it has not yet published.\u00a0\nMaximus is one of just hundreds of organizations impacted by the MOVEit Transfer hacks to appear on Clop\u2019s dark web leak site. This week alone, the ransomware group added a number of new victims, including accountancy giant Deloitte, and global sports betting provider Flutter, which owns Fox Bets and Poker Stars.\u00a0\nIn a statement given to TechCrunch, Deloitte spokesperson Sutton Meagher said that the company\u2019s analysis of the incident \u201cdetermined that our global network use of the vulnerable MOVEit Transfer software is limited,\u201d adding that the company has \u201cseen no evidence of impact to client data.\u201d \nClop also recently listed accountancy firms PwC and Ernst & Young as its latest victims.\nFlutter spokesperson Robert Allan told TechCrunch that the Dublin-headquartered organization \u201chas been impacted\u201d by the MOVEit mass-hacks and has \u201cnotified affected employees and customers.\u201d Flutter, which claims to provide services to more than 18 million customers globally, declined to say how many individuals had been impacted or what types of data had been accessed.\nClop also this week listed Pensions Benefit Information, which provides pension plan management services to various industries. The organization in a brief statement on its website has confirmed it was breached but hasn\u2019t said how many individuals have been impacted. Four of the organization\u2019s clients \u2014 including CalPERS, CalSTRS, Genworth Financial and Wilton Reassurance \u2014 have disclosed that the data of more than 4.75 million people had been accessed.\u00a0\nAccording to the latest figures from cybersecurity company Emsisoft, more than 500 organizations have so far been impacted by the MOVEit mass-hacks, exposing the personal information of more than 34.5 million people.\n\nBanks, hotels and hospitals among latest MOVEit mass-hack victims\n\n",

        "content": "GlossGenius, a platform designed to handle bookings and payments for salons and spas, today announced that it raised $28 million in a Series C funding round led by L Catterton with participation from Bessemer Venture Partners and Imaginary Ventures.\nThe round values GlossGenius at $510 million \u2014 the startup\u2019s second up-round in the past 12 months \u2014 and brings GlossGenius\u2019 total raised to ~$70 million. Founder and CEO Danielle Cohen-Shohet says that it\u2019ll be put toward developing additional products to support business owners in the beauty and wellness sectors, as well as \u201cinvesting in core areas of the GlossGenius team.\u201d\n\u201cAs one of the fastest-growing software companies in the space now powering billions of dollars of annual transaction activity, GlossGenius has become a critical gateway for success and social mobility for business owners that have traditionally been underserved by technology,\u201d Cohen-Shohet told TechCrunch in an email interview.\nCohen-Shohet founded New York-based GlossGenius in 2016, after experiencing the pain points of managing a makeup artistry business and engaging with clients. Prior to starting the company, she and her twin sister, Leah, ran a digital receipts point-of-sale venture that they launched in college. Those experiences served as a springboard for Danielle, who learned how to code to build GlossGenius\u2019 MVP.\n\u201cGiven the many responsibilities that business owners have, they spend countless hours on time-consuming administrative work and processes that keep them from scaling themselves and revenue,\u201d Cohen-Shohet said. \u201cOur product gives businesses complete control over their business, ultimately enabling them to scale themselves and build a unique brand identity and client experience in the same sophisticated way that larger companies would.\u201d\nGlossGenius, similar to software like Toast, ServiceTitan and Procore, is a vertical software embedded payments app \u2014 but one aimed exclusively at the beauty and wellness spaces. Businesses can use the platform to manage workflows across their back and front offices, including flows related to payments, booking, inventory expenses and marketing.\nGlossGenius also offers a card reader, the design of which businesses can customize to match their branding.\n\u201cHistorically, salon, spa and wellness business owners have had limited options \u2014 manual tracking with pen and paper or complex, general one-size-fits-all horizontal solutions or hard-to-use legacy solutions,\u201d Cohen-Shohet said. \u201cMany of these options have led to commoditization of small businesses, stripping any opportunity for customization, brand-identity or personality.\u201d\nBusinesses that choose not to adopt booking tech, though, run the risk of losing out on new clients. According to a 2019 survey of around 1,000 salon and spa customers, only 54% book appointments during a salon\u2019s and spa\u2019s opening hours. Respondents to the poll also cited online booking as the most important feature when visiting a salon\u2019s website.\nWhether for fear of missing out on new business or other post-pandemic-related reasons, GlossGenius\u2019 customer base has continued to expand pretty consistently. Cohen-Shohet claims that over 60,000 spas and beauty salons are now using GlossGenius\u2019 platform, which is handling billions of dollars in activity annually.\nGlossGenius\u2019 booking and payments management platform for spas and salons. Image Credits: GlossGenius\nIt helps that, even before the COVID-19 health crisis, spa and salon owners were showing a willingness to adopt new technologies to drive revenue. A 2019 survey of close to 600 spa and salons in the U.S. found that marketing software, point-of-sales systems and cloud software were the top three areas of investment.\n\u201cUpon re-opening [after the pandemic], we witnessed increased demand for digital products that could help business owners in our space run better businesses,\u201d she added. \u201cDespite a broader slowdown in tech that many companies are seeing, we\u2019ve seen our sector show resilience and continued growth.\u201d\nWhile GlossGenius\u2019 growth is impressive, it\u2019s up against formidable competition. Fresha, which also sells a beauty and wellness booking platform and marketplace, raised $100 million in 2022. That same year, appointment booking app Booksy landed $70 million. Meanwhile, booking vendor Boulevard similarly secured $70 million in a funding round that closed in late 2022.\nIt\u2019s cutthroat. Data from Semrush, cited by Fast Company, shows that 76% of the appointment booking market\u2019s online traffic goes to the top five players in the space: Vagaro, Booksy, Mindbody, Styleseat and Fresha.\nGlossGenius\u2019 challenge going forward will be continuing to stand out as the field grows increasingly crowded.\nL Catterton\u2019s Ian Friedman, unsurprisingly, has faith.\n\u201cGiven our deep expertise in the beauty space and our investments in disruptive software businesses across consumer verticals, we see a compelling opportunity ahead to serve businesses here with better and more powerful tech,\u201d he said via email. \u201cThe overwhelming enthusiasm displayed by GlossGenius\u2019s customers is a testament to the product\u2019s excellence and the company\u2019s position as the go-to platform in the industry.\u201d\n",

        "content": "In an indictment of past administrations, a senior Indian minister blamed their strategic and political vision and \u201ca big dose of incompetence\u201d\u00a0as significant contributors to the country\u2019s underdeveloped semiconductor industry.\n\u201cIndia has missed the bus repeatedly on electronics and semiconductors. There was a lack of strategic and political vision and a big dose of incompetence,\u201d Rajeev Chandrasekhar (pictured above), deputy minister for IT, told a group of reporters Thursday.\n\u201cFairchild semiconductors, which is the precursor to Intel, came to India in 1957 for a packaging unit and we chased them away. That packaging unit went on to become Asia\u2019s largest packaging hub in Malaysia. We set up a fab for silicon and germanium transistors that had shut down. India\u2019s major VLSI facility, Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), perished, as a mysterious fire in 1989 halted production until 1997. In 1987, India was just two years behind the latest chip manufacturing technology. Today, we are 12 generations behind \u2014 this is how far behind as a nation on semiconductors,\u201d said Chandrasekhar, who has been a major proponent of India\u2019s foray into chips.\nAs part of its strategic push into high-value manufacturing, prime minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration has targeted the global semiconductor market. The past two years saw India unveil considerable production-linked incentives to attract investment in critical sectors, from electronics to automobiles and solar energy.\n\u201cThe demand for electronics, digital products and services is only intensifying. Electronics is at the core of our lives today and semiconductors in turn at the core of electronics. Prime minister Shri Narendra Modi has rebuilt our electronics ecosystem and we are one of the world\u2019s fastest growing electronics manufacturers. We were almost nothing in 2014 in the semiconductor ecosystem and today we are increasingly becoming a big presence in the global value chain for electronics,\u201d said Chandrasekhar, who also serves as a union minister for State for skill development and entrepreneurship.\nThese efforts are showing signs of progress: U.S. memory chip firm Micron announced last month that it will invest up to $825 million to build a semiconductor plant in India. Apple has also accelerated production of its iPhone 14 lineup in the country. But there are also some concerns. A multibillion-dollar venture between Foxconn and Indian conglomerate Vedanta ended earlier this month. Indian officials blamed \u201cinternal issues\u201d between the firms for the discontinuation of the joint venture and said the development will not impact India\u2019s semiconductor goals. Foxconn has since said that it remains committed to India and will apply to avail the incentives.\n\u201cBased on our discussions with govt officials and industry participants, we believe India possesses several key ingredients for success such as rising demand, low manufacturing cost, large fiscal support and strategic goodwill with the West; although, might need to strengthen supply chains and tech partnerships,\u201d Jefferies analysts wrote in a recent note.\n",

        "content": "The European Union has finally announced a formal antitrust investigation of Microsoft\u2019s bundling of Teams with Office 365 and Microsoft 365.\nThe move comes two years after rival workplace comms company Slack complained to the bloc that Microsoft was unfairly bundling the collaboration and comms software with its popular cloud-based productivity suites for business.\nAnnouncing the probe, the European Commission said it will look into whether Microsoft may have breached EU competition rules by tying or bundling Teams to Office 365\u00a0and\u00a0Microsoft 365.\n\u201cThe Commission is concerned that Microsoft may be abusing and defending its market position in productivity software by restricting competition in the European Economic Area (\u2018EEA\u2019) for communication and collaboration products,\u201d it wrote.\n\u201cIn particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may grant Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice on whether or not to include access to that product when they subscribe to their productivity suites and may have limited the interoperability between its productivity suites and competing offerings.\u201d\nThe Commission said Microsoft\u2019s practices may constitute \u201canti-competitive tying or bundling\u201d \u2014 meaning they could prevent suppliers of other communication and collaboration tools, such as Slack, from competing on a level playing field.\nReached for comment, a Microsoft spokeswoman sent this statement:\nWe respect the European Commission\u2019s work on this case and take our own responsibilities very seriously. We will continue to cooperate with the Commission and remain committed to finding solutions that will address its concerns.\nBack in July 2020, Slack made its complaint to the EU about Microsoft public \u2014 accusing the tech giant of illegally tying Teams into its market-dominant Office productivity suite and claiming its actions had resulted in \u201cforce installing it for millions, blocking its removal, and hiding the true cost to enterprise customers\u201d.\nMicrosoft rebutted the accusations at the time by claiming Teams had been \u201cembraced\u201d by the market in \u201crecord numbers\u201d as a result of COVID-19 driving uptake of video conferencing and other digital comms tools.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Slack for a response to the Commission investigation.\nTwo years ago Slack urged EU regulators to move quickly. It\u2019s not clear why the EU has taken its time to act on what is, on the surface, a pretty straightforward complaint \u2014 about bundling and tying. But the landscape around regulating digital giants is in the process of changing in the EU so the Commission may be reconfiguring its response to complaints.\nIn response to questions about the timing of the investigation, a Commission spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing Slack\u2019s complaint in 2020, we have conducted an investigation into Microsoft\u2019s practices and the markets concerned.\u201d\n\u201cThe duration of an antitrust investigation depends on a number of factors, including the complexity of the case and the extent to which the companies concerned cooperate with the Commission, and require careful assessment,\u201d they added.\u00a0\nTypically, traditional (ex post) antitrust investigations can take years to carry out. Although the Commission does have the ability to deploy interim powers in situations where it believes a suspected abuse of competition could cause irreversible harm to competition \u2014 as happened in 2019 in its investigation of chipmaker Broadcom \u2014 albeit, the more common route for the bloc\u2019s competition regulators has been to investigate first to confirm a breach before taking enforcement action.\nThe EU\u2019s executive also now has additional antitrust enforcement powers, under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which started to apply in May.\nThis new ex ante competition regime does also look set to apply to Microsoft\u2019s business. We\u2019re still waiting on official designations but earlier this month the tech giant informed the Commission it believes it meets the criteria for falling under the regime.\nThe DMA is targeted at the most powerful digital intermediaries (so-called \u201cgatekeepers\u201d) \u2014 and at key competitive pinch-points for digital business. The regulation puts a set of up-front obligations and restrictions on designated gatekeepers\u2019 core platform services, including limits on their ability to self-favor (such as by bundling or tying). Although exactly which core platform services will be regulated and how exactly the regime\u2019s prohibitions will be interpreted in each case remains to be seen. (But on paper the DMA should apply in areas that look relevant to Slack\u2019s complaint about Microsoft, including communications services and cloud services.)\nWith this revised regulatory landscape coming into the play in the EU, Microsoft may, in fairly short order, face up-front restrictions on how it can operate its popular productivity suites which could force it to cut its rivals a little more slack, so to speak. And this factor may explain why it\u2019s taken the Commission a bit of time to decide what to do about Slack\u2019s complaint.\nEnforcement of the DMA is also in the hands of the Commission so it remains to be seen which gatekeepers and core platform services will face priority attention from the bloc once the deadline for compliance expires early next year.\nThis report was updated with the Commission\u2019s response to questions about the timing of the investigation\n\nSlack has filed an antitrust complaint over Microsoft Teams in the EU\n\n",

        "content": "One of the many benefits of electric vehicles is waking up to a full charge. Weekday commutes and weekend errands don\u2019t have to be interrupted by emergency trips to the gas station. Instead, all drivers have to do is plug the car in every night, just like they do with their phones.\nMost electric vehicle drivers plug in when they arrive home for the evening, typically around 6 p.m. Then they unplug at around 7 a.m. to leave for the day. But the vehicles themselves are typically drawing current for only about three hours.\nMany EV chargers start delivering electrons immediately. For now, with EVs accounting for only a small portion of the market, that\u2019s not much of a problem. But EV sales have been growing rapidly, and in the near future, when dozens of drivers plug in at around the same time, the surge of demand could easily overwhelm the grid.\nThat surge doesn\u2019t have to happen, though. Most plugged-in EVs sit idle for about 10 hours every night, meaning if they could coordinate their charging sessions to smooth the demand curve, they\u2019d save utilities billions in avoided electrical grid upgrades.\nSome, not all, utilities have attempted to do this through time-of-use rates that offer consumers cheaper prices at times when demand is lower. That requires smart meters, which are far from ubiquitous. Others are attempting to flatten the curve by offering discounts or rebates on smart EV chargers that turn on when the grid has electricity to spare.\nU.K.-based startup EV.energy is working to combine those nascent efforts with others into a software platform that can help tell drivers, EVs and chargers when and where to plug in. The company on Thursday announced a $33 million Series B led by National Grid Partners with participation from new investors Aviva Ventures, WEX Venture Capital and InMotion Ventures, as well as existing investors Energy Impact Partners, Future Energy Ventures and ArcTern Ventures.\nWhile the company\u2019s ultimate customers are utilities, it has to convince drivers to use its services. To do that, EV.energy coordinates with utilities like ConEd and National Grid to offer a range of incentives, from rebates or lower rates for charging during off-peak times to rewards for completing a certain number of off-peak charging sessions. Drivers with solar panels can also prioritize charging when their panels are producing, and customers who skip charging sessions during times of grid stress can earn bonuses.",

        "content": "Upgrade, a provider of personal credit lines and other consumer financial products, today announced that it\u2019s agreed to acquire Uplift, the buy now, pay later (BNPL) vendor, for $100 million in cash and stock.\nIt\u2019s likely not the exit Uplift was hoping for \u2014 and a sign of serious consolidation in the BNPL space, which just a few years ago was booming, buoyed by pandemic-era spending habits. Uplift had raised nearly $700 million in equity and debt, securing $123 million at a reported $195 million valuation in its Series C round alone.\nIn a conversation with TechCrunch, Renaud Laplanche, Upgrade\u2019s CEO and a co-founder, said that Uplift initially reached out in May to inquire whether Upgrade would be interested in participating in Uplift\u2019s Series D financing as a strategic investor. Upgrade, however, thought a purchase made more sense \u2014 and it\u2019s tough to argue with that logic. Upgrade arguably got Uplift for a song.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of areas of potential synergy,\u201d Laplanche said. \u201cWe\u2019re already providing BNPL and financing at the point of sale for home improvements and auto purchases, so this is really an expansion of our strategy into travel as another vertical and another significant need of consumers.\u201d\nLaplanche is referring to the BNPL-style product that Upgrade launched in October 2021, which lets users pay down their debt over six to 36 months with a fixed interest rate. Like many BNPL products on the market, Upgrade\u2019s features a checkout option on merchants\u2019 websites that allows Upgrade to group a user\u2019s card purchases into one lump some and invoice them what they owe over four months.\nIn Uplift, Upgrade saw a gateway to a previously untapped portion of the BNPL segment: travel. Uplift, Laplanche noted, has a distribution network that includes 300 of the top airlines, cruise lines and hotel chains \u2014 a network that\u2019d be tough to build from scratch.\n\u201cTravel is a big market, obviously \u2014 over $450 billion in annual consumer spending \u2014 and a significant area of financing and payments needs for our customers, so we believe there is a great opportunity to keep growing the distribution and user base,\u201d Laplanche said.\nUplift was founded in 2014 by Brian Barth, who previously sold his travel startup SideStep to Kayak for $200 million. From the start, the focus was travel, with an emphasis on partnerships with the vacation package sites of United Airlines, Southwest and American Airlines as well as Allegiant Travel Company and Kayak.\nUplift\u2019s core offering was installment plans for trips. For example, if a family was considering a trip to Disneyland for a price of $2,000, Uplift might\u2019ve offered a one-year financing plan with monthly payments of $189 a month.\nAt one point, Uplift was on track to drive nearly $1 billion in loans \u2014 or so the company\u2019s president, Robert Soderbery, claimed. And those rosy prospects attracted major backers like Madrone Capital Partners, DNX Ventures and Ridge Ventures. But evidently, business sagged somewhere down the line.\nTo blame could be general malaise in the BNPL sector post-pandemic, particularly among consumer-focused BNPL vendors.\nKlarna, once Europe\u2019s most valuable VC-backed company, suffered an 85% valuation cut, from $45.6 billion to just $6.7 billion in July 2022 following an $800 million round. Meanwhile, publicly traded BNPL companies like Affirm and Australia\u2019s Zip have seen their share prices plummet; Affirm was recently forced to shut down its crypto unit and lay off 19% of its staff.\nChanging consumer spending habits likely played a role in scaring investors away. But the threat of stricter oversight \u2014 and rising delinquency rates \u2014 undoubtedly had something to do with it, too.\nThe purchase of Uplift effectively doubles Upgrade\u2019s customer base, adding 3.3 million users to the platform, and comes as Upgrade weighs an IPO. Laplanche previously said that Upgrade would aim for a public offering sometime in 2023, but it\u2019s unclear whether the company\u2019s still committed to that timeline.\nOver the past several years \u2014 perhaps in anticipation of an IPO, whenever it ends up arriving \u2014 Upgrade has sought to diversify its offerings, launching a rewards checking account, a Bitcoin rewards card, a credit card with BNPL-like options and a debit rewards card for everyday purchases. Laplanche says that Upgrade\u2019s looking to provide close to $10 billion in credit by year-end 2023.\n\u201cTravel has become more expensive in the last couple of years, and we\u2019re glad we can provide financing for yet another large expense category, and make that financing more affordable through Upgrade\u2019s access to low-cost capital,\u201d he added. \u201cThis \u2018merchant network\u2019 strategy is a great complement to the direct-to-consumer strategy we\u2019ve implemented with mobile banking, cards and loans.\u201d\nUplift\u2019s team will join Upgrade in \u201cvarious capacities,\u201d Laplanche says, moving from their current teams to corresponding teams at Upgrade (e.g. finance to finance). That includes Uplift execs, who\u2019ll be joining Upgrade in their respective field, including CEO Brian Barth as head of strategy.\n",

        "title": "Patently messy: How a $6B deal may spur more IP lawsuits",
        "content": "A megabucks enterprise acquisition that closed six months ago could lead to thousands of patents landing on the open market.\nLast August, Canadian enterprise technology giant OpenText announced plans to acquire U.K.-based IT software vendor and consultancy Micro Focus for a chunky $6 billion, a deal that closed on January 31. In our coverage at the time, TechCrunch considered various takes on what it might mean for their respective customers, and the motivations behind the deal.\nChief among them, Micro Focus\u2019s assets would help OpenText diversify its product suite and become a stickier proposition. But there are fears that OpenText also could capitalize on something else: a windfall of thousands of patents amassed by Micro Focus.\nNow, with Micro Focus set to end its membership of anti-patent troll organization LOT Network next week, the big question will be: What will OpenText do next?\nPAE off\nOver a period of nearly 50 years, Micro Focus racked up a catalog of thousands of patents both through internal R&D \u2014 it started as an early pioneer in COBOL \u2014 and acquisitions. Its procurement history included legacy software companies such as Borland, Novell (via its 2014 Attachmate acquisition), Serena Software and certain software assets of HPE.\nEven as recently as the months before, during and after OpenText\u2019s approach in August 2022, Micro Focus had dozens of patents granted through applications it had made years earlier, spanning everything from machine learning-based network device profiling and stateless password management to blockchain-based transaction methods.\nBack in 2021, however, Micro Focus had joined LOT Network, a nonprofit outfit that promises to protect its members through an agreement that automatically cross-licenses patents that fall into the hands of patent assertion entities (PAEs). Such PAEs \u2014 also called non-practicing entities (NPEs) or more commonly \u201cpatent trolls\u201d \u2014 are organizations that make most of their revenue through patent enforcement, shell companies set up to assert those rights with no tangible products or R&D associated with the patents.\nThe LOT Network counts thousands of members: Google, Amazon, Uber, Salesforce, Facebook, Microsoft, eBay, Netflix, Airbnb, ByteDance and IBM, though there are plenty of smaller companies in there too, from fledgling startups to pre-IPO scale-ups. The idea is that when a company joins LOT, it commits to ensuring that none of its patents end up in the hands of a PAE. If the patents do end up there, then all LOT members are automatically granted a license to the patents, making them immune to future litigation in perpetuity for as long as they remain members of LOT \u2014 even if the patent holder itself leaves LOT.\nThis arrangement isn\u2019t designed to deter patent enforcement in general \u2014 there are many legitimate scenarios that may require member companies to assert their IP rights. In fact, there are examples of LOT Network members suing one another for patent infringement, for example Google\u2019s sibling Waymo\u2019s suing Uber for trade secret theft, and IBM pursuing Airbnb for patent infringements for some six years, eventually settling the case in 2020.\nThese kinds of patent assertions are fine under LOT\u2019s terms. This is because the companies involved aren\u2019t PAEs, which it defines as any company that derives more than half of its revenues from patent enforcement (litigation or licensing).\nIn other words, LOT is essentially a deterrent mechanism more than anything else, discouraging would-be trolls from snapping up patents for the express purpose of litigation or licensing. Companies are free to end their LOT membership at any point, with the understanding that they will no longer be protected from PAE patent litigation.\nBut on the flip-side, this also frees them to do whatever they want with their patents, including selling them to the highest bidder \u2014 whoever that may be.\nPatent boost\nAll this leads us back to OpenText, which now owns thousands of granted and pending patents, aggregating its own holdings with those of its recent acquisition.\nNotably, Micro Focus officially handed in its resignation notice to LOT Network in March, though in reality the resignation was somewhat moot as LOT\u2019s T&Cs state that when a member is acquired, the acquiring company has to join the organization to remain covered. If this doesn\u2019t happen, the membership is automatically cancelled six months from the acquisition date \u2014 which, in this case, is July 31. (OpenText has never been a member of the LOT Network.)\nWhat this means is that Micro Focus (and thus its patents) will no longer be subject to the LOT Network agreement, and OpenText will be free to use them however it wants. LOT members who joined before Micro Focus\u2019s exit date (July 31) will continue to be protected regardless. But from August 1 onwards, any other company could be a potential litigation or licensing target should the patents end up in the hands of a PAE.\nWhile LOT Network membership would be irrelevant if OpenText were to decide to assert these patents itself \u2014 remember, it\u2019s a legitimate operating company \u2014 there is always a danger that these patents could be sold on to another entity, including a patent troll.\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s a possibility that in the future, one way OpenText might choose to deal with these patents would be to sell them to a PAE,\u201d LOT Network\u2019s VP of partnerships and thought leadership Sam Wiley said in an interview with TechCrunch.\nWiley isn\u2019t alone in voicing concerns. IP attorney Patrick McBride, who most recently headed up IP programs at Red Hat, said that while it\u2019s impossible to know how these patents might be leveraged, OpenText likely has something specific in mind for them.\n\u201cOne would assume that the reason they are removing those assets from the LOT Network is to do something with them, as they would be free to use them for their own operating company purposes while staying in the network,\u201d McBride said. \u201cYou have to conclude that they have some purpose in mind for them by withdrawing them.\u201d\nTechCrunch reached out to OpenText for comment, but was told that it doesn\u2019t comment on business decisions such as this.\nPAE concerns aside, though, recent behavior indicates that OpenText might in fact be open to asserting these patents itself, with litigation one possible outcome.\nLegacy software\nOpenText makes most of its annual revenue through its business, which involves helping companies manage their content and data. Over the past decade, its market cap has roughly tripled to more than $11 billion. A chunk of this growth has been off the back of buying legacy software companies, securing countless patents along the way. But some of its actions in recent times have led to accusations that it\u2019s behaving like a patent troll itself.\nBack in 2019, OpenText acquired Carbonite, a data security firm that itself had acquired a 25-year-old endpoint security company called Webroot earlier that same year. Fast-forward to March 2022, and Webroot (backed by its parent OpenText) initiated patent litigation proceedings against CrowdStrike, Kaspersky, Sophos and Trend Micro, with claims that its cybsersecurity rivals were using malware detection techniques protected by patents owned by Webroot.\nA CrowdStrike spokesperson said at the time that this is something it would \u201cexpect from a patent troll\u201d rather than a cybersecurity company. \u201cLegitimate licensing discussions start with a phone call, not a lawsuit,\u201d they said.\nTrend Micro COO Kevin Simzer echoed this sentiment, saying that \u201cdesperate times call for desperate measures\u201d from OpenText.\n\u201cPerhaps OpenText is struggling with the less-than-successful assets they have acquired over the years, so they need to transform into a patent troll type of company,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will vigorously defend ourselves.\u201d\nGoing further back, OpenText has something of a history of patent litigation, settling with rival Alfresco back in 2014 before going after cloud storage company Box and its government procurement partner Carahsoft in 2015. It also currently has litigation against Alfresco\u2019s parent Hyland Software over patents covering remote data-storage technology.\n\u201cOpenText is definitely not a PAE \u2014 it makes most of its money from technology,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cBut compared to its peers, especially on the cybersecurity side, they\u2019re pretty aggressive with patent licensing.\u201d\nData from Clarivate\u2019s Darts IP database, cited by LOT Network, indicates that OpenText has asserted in the region of 40 patents, spanning 19 separate patent litigations, in the past decade.\nWhile the main motive behind buying Micro Focus might well be its ability to generate more direct revenue for its new parent, it\u2019s clear from OpenText\u2019s recent past that patent litigation is on its agenda. And Micro Focus adds significant ammunition to its arsenal, with LOT Network estimating that Micro Focus essentially doubles OpenText\u2019s patent trove. This trove isn\u2019t cheap to administer, either.\nFigures derived from Clarivate\u2019s Innography suggests that Micro Focus has been paying as much as $3 million each year to manage its patent portfolio, which may include registering or renewing patents, monitoring their use (or misuse) across hundreds or thousands of markets. So one way to reduce these overheads, while simultaneously making money, would be to sell some of these patents to a third-party, such as a PAE.\n\u201cIf you look at OpenText\u2019s patent portfolio, it\u2019s probably much larger than it needs to be,\u201d Wiley added. \u201cThose portfolios are very expensive to maintain, you have to pay maintenance to all the different patent offices. And so one possibility would be that OpenText says, \u2018Hey, the best way to get a return on these patents is to sell to a PAE.'\u201d\nThis may also tie in with other cost-cutting measures OpenText announced post-acquisition, which effectively translated into an 8% workforce reduction to save $400 million in outgoings.\nMicro Focus International PLC: Active patents, annual spend. Image Credits: Clarivate / LOT Network\nIf patent litigation is on the agenda, OpenText might pursue its own route, but there are inherent risks associated with that. An operating company might not want to get too litigious, given the inherent costs, uncertainties and reputational risks associated with that. In which case, selling at least some to a PAE might be a better option in the long run.\nEither way, though, when you consider that OpenText has proactively removed Micro Focus from LOT, and has been actively engaging in litigation to loud cries of \u201cpatent trolls,\u201d this could spell trouble for some companies out there.\n",

        "content": "After Twitter\u2019s (now X) rollout of a new paid plan offering verification, other social media companies like Meta, LinkedIn and Tumblr have tried to implement their own badges. Reddit is now joining the bandwagon by testing a new \u201cofficial\u201d badge.\nThe company said it is testing these labels with a small set of profiles as proof of authenticity. The label appears like a flair next to the username.\n\u201cThis is currently only available to a *very* small (double-digit) number of profiles belonging to organizations with whom we already have existing relationships, and who are interested in engaging with Redditors and communities on our platform,\u201d the company said in a post.\nImage Credits: Reddit\nReddit clarified that the official label is only visible on its iOS and Android apps for now. The social network didn\u2019t specify if there will be an application process or any charge attached to the verification when it opens up for other organizations or users.\nThe company is also rolling out a change to automod notifications. From now on, Reddit will run the moderator bot on a comment or a reply to check if it follows Reddit\u2019s rules, and only send a notification to users if the post is not removed. This prevents some confusion from ghost notifications where users would click or tap on them to find that the post doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\nThe promise of accessibility features\nIn a separate post, Reddit also outlined its roadmap to roll out accessibility features on its own apps. The company said that parts of the service, such as the left navigation menu, profile drawer, bottom tab bar (which includes buttons for creating a post, Chat and Inbox) Community page, post detail page and Home & Popular feeds will be compatible with screen readers next month.\nThis is the company\u2019s move to appease the community heavily protesting Reddit\u2019s API changes last month, which forced many apps with good accessibility features to shut down. The company exempted accessibility-focused apps from paying for its API as long as they don\u2019t have commercial intents. However, moderators were not happy with the functionality of those apps at the time.\nEarlier this week, r/Blind moderators posted on the community that the Reddit app\u2019s recent updates have made it worse for screen readers. Additionally, after announcing an accessibility feedback group, the company didn\u2019t reach out to moderators who filled out the form.\nWith the latest announcement, a Reddit admin said that the company will start reaching out to people next week. u/MostlyBlindGamer, a moderator for r/Blind, complained that the company hasn\u2019t held a feedback meeting for a month and it is sending \u201cmixed signals.\u201d\nGiven the massive changes to the platform in the last few months, users are still protesting them in whatever way possible. Last week, the community took to r/Place, an event where people collaboratively paint on a massive digital whiteboard on Reddit, to protest these changes.\n",

        "content": "As one of the well-known data and cloud martech companies in Africa, Terragon, via several products, gives its clients (primarily telecommunications and financial services companies) data on the continent\u2019s growing consumer markets.\nAdrenaline, one of its main products, is a telco-data monetization solution that lets telcos diversify their income and marketers access specialized audiences otherwise unavailable through traditional marketing channels. Finally, these tools enable Terragon corporate clients to drill down on various combinations of behavioral and demographic information, reach consumers via multiple channels both online and offline and link to various touch points, including online sales and payment systems.\nThe cloud analytics and marketing platform earned $5 million in Series A funding in 2018, which it utilized to further develop Adrenaline into the Terragon Marketing Cloud with over 150 million segmented profiles in Nigeria. Today, the firm, which converts telco channels into mobile advertising inventory, announced a $9 million Series B round to expand its focus on offering mobile B2C messaging backed by deep consumer insights from \u201cbig data.\u201d The round was led by Orange Ventures with participation from TLcom Capital, LoftyInc, Sango Capital, VestedWorld and Western Technology Investment (WTI).\nThe investment, according to the business, would allow it to strengthen cloud-native capabilities on its platform as well as develop and accelerate localized ML and AI to provide the foundations for increased enterprise communication. The company hopes to kickstart its Pan-African expansion (which it is already doing in Ghana and Kenya), according to founder and CEO Elo Umeh in an interview with TechCrunch. Umeh said that the growth investment, together with interest from French telecom giants and collaborations with AWS and Microsoft, lends credence to Africa\u2019s market maturity in cloud and martech.\nIn February, four of Europe\u2019s largest carriers (Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telekom, France\u2019s Orange, Spain\u2019s Telef\u00f3nica, and the U.K.\u2019s Vodafone) formed a joint venture to target mobile consumers with opt-in advertising. Furthermore, these telcos want to use this partnership (TrustPid) to capitalize on high-level changes to the third-party tracking cookie status quo in order to generate ad income by developing cross-operator ad-targeting infrastructure based on first-party data.\nGoogle has said that third-party cookies would be phased out to improve user privacy. According to the ad giant, third-party cookies violate users\u2019 privacy by allowing websites to follow them without their knowledge. The elimination of third-party cookies will have several consequences for the online advertising industry, as advertisers will no longer be able to track users across multiple websites, and they will need to find new ways to collect, analyze, and tailor customer data to provide personalized ads and experiences to customers.\nBusinesses will need to integrate various identification solutions instead of relying on third-party cookies to achieve this. And, to accurately profile customers, a central Customer Data Platform (CDP) that relies on a first-party data source (like TrustPid) and combines this with other online data sources appears to be the solution, similar to what Terragon has done with various telcos in the African market for several years, including MTN Nigeria.\n\nAfrican VC TLcom Capital invests $5M in Nigerian data analytics firm Terragon Group\n\nSo how did Terragon develop something that Europe is playing catch-up on? The development of Adrenaline was aided by Africa being a mobile-first continent. Since email addresses, and not mobile phone numbers, have traditionally been the unique identifiers for digital services in Europe, this has limited the multiple sources that can be harnessed by solutions like TrustPid to identify and track customers. As a result, Europe and the Global North generally find themselves on the back foot.\nAs a mobile-only continent, Africa has experienced significant internet connectivity growth in recent years. Nearly half a billion users subscribe to mobile services in Africa, and mobile numbers remain the unique identifiers for digital services, as many users do not have email addresses. So, in signing up for platforms like Jumia and Netflix, customers use their phone numbers, not email addresses, like in Europe. Therefore, this structure (including Terragon\u2019s DSP, which is connected to major online publishers, including Google ad exchange) allows advertisers and marketers on the continent to continue running targeting customer engagements required.\n\u201cWe placed a bet on the mobile phone number as a unique ID. In other parts of the world, most of the unique IDs have been email. Digital advertising has been driven by email up to three years or four years ago because that\u2019s the evolution in the West. But now we\u2019re seeing a migration from email to mobile phone numbers because of trends in emerging markets,\u201d Umeh said on the call. \u201cAnd Europe is noticing an intersection between what happens on the mobile phone and eventually what will happen in enterprises because retail media has grown astronomically. So how can they solve for privacy? By coming closer to the supply side (telcos), and changing the unique identifier to the mobile phone number because that is what Facebook, Google and others are using. When the European platform comes on stream, I think the entire world will migrate to it.\u201d\nNonetheless, it\u2019s worth noting that Africa has less stringent comprehensive privacy regulations for consumers than Europe, making it easier for Terragon to grow its services on the continent. Umeh stated that the company\u2019s revenue has risen 10x since its Series A in 2018, with a 100% year-over-year growth rate projected until 2023.\nMicrosoft, Unilever, Access, Fidelity, and FCMB are among Terragon\u2019s partners and clients, as well as telecoms such as MTN. According to Umeh, the company has a customer retention rate of more than 50% quarter over quarter.\n\u201cTerragon is poised to ride a wave that will intersect software, traditional telcos, enterprise and digital native businesses. The size of the opportunity was very convincing to us, their existing ambition and investment in Africa-focused software products was compelling, as well as the vision of how African mobile users will evolve in coming years, fit right into the strategy of Orange Ventures,\u201d Gr\u00e9goire de Padirac, partner at Orange Ventures, said of the investment.\n\u201cThey are Africa\u2019s pioneer specializing in cloud-native data software, which serves as the fundamental building blocks for enterprise AI across the continent. With protected intellectual property, an inventive business model, and a strong presence in multiple markets, they are well-positioned to establish a strong leadership across the continent.\u201d\n\nUh oh! European carriers are trying to get into \u2018personalized\u2019 ad targeting\n\n",

        "content": "Bloom Money, a U.K.-based fintech, has raised \u00a31 million to digitize an informal financial management system employed by ethnic communities across the world.\nOften referred to as \u201crotating savings and credit association\u201d (ROSCA), the model varies in the details around the world, but usually, it involves an informal gathering of people from a certain community who act as a bank, collecting and saving money that members can withdraw. The system is called different names across the world, such as \u201chagbad\u201d in Somalia or \u201cpardna\u201d in parts of the Caribbean.\nThe goal is to avoid conventional banking systems, many of which discriminate against minority communities, especially in the U.K., CEO Nina Mohanty said. \u201cSome of it is just blatant racism. We don\u2019t have clear red-lining like in the U.S., but there are definitely postcode look-ups,\u201d she said.\nThe ROSCA system is a way to conduct financial matters with people you trust, she said, \u201cwhether that is by race, nationality, we\u2019ve even got people down to the tribe level.\u201d Bloom Money wants to digitize this ROSCA process.\nA daughter of two immigrants to the U.S., Mohanty says she decided to work on this problem after she moved to the U.K. and learned for herself just how difficult it can be for an immigrant to set themselves up financially. \u201cI just felt that there was not just an economic justice point to this, but also a huge opportunity, where people only think of the U.S. as a country of immigrants, but increasingly across Europe, we know migration is growing,\u201d she said.\nHer co-founder and CTO Dan James believes in the system because he\u2019s seen how effective it can be, growing up in an ethnic community in central Birmingham. \u201cI saw firsthand the benefits that using ROSCAs can bring people, especially those entering the U.K. who have historically been underserved by the existing financial sector,\u201d he said.\nThe company will use the funds from the pre-seed round to continue building its digital savings features, which has all funds safeguarded by an electronic money institution. The fundraising was led by Zinal Growth, and saw January Ventures, Pact VC and angel investors B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Magistretti and June Angelides M.B.E. participating.\nBloom Money lets people create groups, known as \u201cBloom circles,\u201d to share and save money with. It also has educational materials on the basics of life in the U.K., such as how to get a driver\u2019s license, setting up a trust fund and an explainer on credit scores.\nImage Credits: Bloom Money\nMohanty described the fundraising process as \u201creally interesting.\u201d She said the most challenging part was explaining to investors that the company intended to target very underserved communities. At first, there was a lot of misunderstanding, she said. \u201cSome very racist, xenophobic things were said to us,\u201d she said. \u201cEven going through the regulation process, there was a lot of prejudice that we had to overcome.\u201d\nMohanty and James say they wanted ethnic and gender diversity on their cap table, and they seem to have managed that so far: Nearly 70% of their cap table identifies as women, almost 50% comes from a minority ethnic background and about half identify as first or second-generation immigrants.\nAngelides, an angel investor, said Bloom Money was her first angel fintech investment, and she knew right off the bat how big of a problem the company is trying to solve since she grew up in Nigeria, where cash is king. \u201cCommunities have struggled for generations with trust in financial systems and have preferred to use community-based saving methods, such as Ajo (the Nigerian version of the ROSCA system).\u201d\n\u201cThis comes with its own set of problems, from people absconding with funds to people being unable to significantly grow wealth. This is where Bloom Money comes in,\u201d Angelidas added. \u201cA lot of migrant communities remit large amounts to their home countries each year. With Bloom, they now also have an opportunity to build stronger ties with the U.K., grow their wealth and qualify for additional products that they ordinarily would have struggled to access.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Samsung Electronics continues to cut back its memory chip production, including NAND flash used in smartphones and PCs, after reporting a $3.4 billion (4.36 trillion won) operating loss in the second quarter of this year in its memory chip unit. The world\u2019s biggest memory chip maker posted a roughly $7 billion operating loss in its semiconductor business in the first half of 2023.\u00a0\nThe move comes after Samsung slashed its memory chip production in April after hitting the worst quarterly profits since 2009 as demand for consumer devices remained weak.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe tech giant, however, is aiming to generate a brighter AI picture for the future: It said that it plans to double down on producing high-performance memory chips like high-bandwidth memory (HBM) by 2024 due to robust AI demand. HBM, used in AI, 5G, the Internet of Things (IoT), graphic processing applications, virtual reality and augmented reality systems, provides faster data processing and lower power consumption compared to the traditional NAND.\u00a0\n\u201cServer demand remained weak as customers continued to adjust inventories, but demand for high-density/high-performance products stayed strong, driven by increased investments focusing on AI by major hyperscalers,\u201d the company said.\nOn an earnings call today, the executive vice president of Samsung\u2019s memory division Jaejune Kim said it would continue its memory chip production cuts, adjusting for specific products, but will double its capacities of high-performance memory chips, including HBM, as the demand for those advanced memory chips is expected to grow continually.\u00a0\nTwo main memory chips \u2014 DRAM and NAND \u2014 are used in devices from smartphones to servers at data centers. For example, DRAM memory enables large language models, including OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, to perform more advanced functions. DRAM also helps speed up process data for multitasking and building complex AI applications. NAND helps store data.\u00a0\nSamsung laid out its plan for the foundry business\u00a0to introduce 2-nanometer production for mobile phone parts by 2025.\u00a0\nThe firm reported Thursday its companywide operating profits of 670 billion won (approximately $524 million) in the second quarter of 2023, down from 14.1 trillion won a year earlier. The figure is better than expected: Samsung\u2019s preliminary report issued earlier this month estimated its Q2 operating profits would likely be a 96% plunge, 600 billion won ($459 million).\nDespite operating profits dropping 95% in the second quarter, Samsung expects global demand for memory chips to rebound gradually in the second half of this year.\u00a0\n\u201cGlobal demand is expected to gradually recover in the second half of the year, which should lead to an improvement in earnings driven by the component business,\u201d Samsung said in a statement. \u201cHowever, continued macroeconomic risks could prove to be a challenge in such recovery in demand.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nJust yesterday, Samsung unveiled its latest device models \u2014 Galaxy Z Fold 5, Galaxy Z Flip 5,\u00a0Galaxy Tap S9\u00a0and\u00a0Galaxy Watch 6/Watch 6 Classic\u00a0\u2014 at the \u201cUnpacked\u201d international product launch event in its home country for the first time.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

        "content": "FarmWorks, a Kenyan agtech that provides farmers with access to farm inputs, and market for their produce, has raised $4.1 million in a pre-Series A round led by Acumen Resilient Agriculture Fund, an existing investor. Livelihood Impact Fund, Vested World, a number of family offices and angel investors also participated in the round that brought the total equity funding raised by FarmWorks to $5.6 million.\nFarmWorks CEO Yi Li, who co-founded the startup with Peter Muthee in 2020, told TechCrunch that they will use the funding to strengthen their data analytics capabilities, and use AI to enhance production and influence planting and lending decisions.\nFarmWorks runs an out-grower scheme that brings together more than 2,000 smallholder farmers, which has helped it to build a supply chain network that ensures timely delivery of quality produce. It plans to grow its network of contract farmers in other regions within Kenya, in addition to the two counties in the central region of the country, where it is currently operational and has 16 collection centers.\nThe startup provides farmers with farm inputs, and pest control services, and buys their produce for export, or local sales. It also provides them with farming equipment like drip irrigation kits, on loan.\n\u201cWe are transforming what they are farming, and their income by introducing higher value crops like sugar snaps and snow peas, and finding the market. So, we become vertically integrated from day-one in both the production and the distribution side of the business,\u201d said Li.\n\nAfrican climate startups set to gain ground as VC funding shifts their way\n\nThe startup is tapping gaps in Kenya\u2019s agriculture sector, which accounts for 20% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and employs 70% of people in the rural areas, according to this report. However, while agriculture remains a critical sector for the Kenyan economy, small scale farmers, who are the majority, are faced with myriad challenges, including lack of quality farm inputs, information on good agricultural practices, inadequate advisory support and unpredictable or unreliable markets.\nThe startup also teaches the farmers on good agricultural practices, which it demonstrates on its own trial farms.\n\u201cWe have a strong belief that the huge issue facing farmers in Kenya is production \u2014 the low yield is mainly due to poor farming practices, and soil degradation that has happened over the years,\u201d said Li, who added that the startup is unlocking production and by boosting farmers\u2019 capacity. The startup sells about 400 tons of farm produce a month.\nFarmWorks previously engaged in crop production on its own farms, which it has now turned into training centers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of operational expenditure in running a big farm, and we realized that for the same efforts, we can cover a lot more farmers. That is why this year, we made a strategic decision to scale our out-grower scheme because that seemed to pick up much faster. We will be using our farms as training centers,\u201d said Li. Li previously worked in Kenya as a management consultant for McKinsey, prior to launching FarmWorks with Muthee, who has been in the agriculture space for nearly three decades.\n\nTwiga starts commercial farming, looking to guarantee quality, sustain supply\n\n",

        "content": "Looking to ride the tracks of increasing demand for longer distance train travel that\u2019s being fuelled by climate-concerned consumers seeking to shrink the environmental impact of their trips, tree-planting search engine Ecosia and multimodal travel booking platform Omio have partnered to launch what they\u2019re billing as a \u201ctree-planting rail travel booking tool\u201d.\nThe idea is to make it easier for environmentally conscious Ecosia users who are searching the web for travel options to find and book low carbon train routes for their trips \u2014 helping to reduce carbon emissions from less environmentally friendly transport options (like flights) and fund not-for-profit Ecosia\u2019s climate friendly tree-planting projects (and other decarbonization efforts) along the way.\nThe tie-up works by responding to Ecosia users\u2019 travel keyword searches \u2014 in cases where the route can be served by train, such as \u201cLondon to Cologne\u201d or \u201cMunich to Berlin\u201d \u2014 by popping up the \u201cEcosia Trains\u201d tool (pictured below). The integration lets users search for basic parameters of their journey directly within Ecosia. If they like the results the search returns and decide they do want to take the train the tool will then redirect them to a check-out page on Omio\u2019s platform to make a booking.\nImage Credits: Ecosia\nGiven there\u2019s an extra step of being passed from Ecosia\u2019s site to Omio\u2019s to actually do the booking, the tool is perhaps better described as a \u201ctree-planting rail travel search tool\u201d. Certainly it\u2019s not \u2018seamless\u2019 one-click booking. But the basic idea is to boost discoverability of low carbon intercity and long haul transport options and ease train trip booking for climate conscious Ecosia users without them having to do the leg work of browsing to Omio\u2019s website (or, indeed, another train trip booking platform such as Trainline) first.\nEcosia said it receives\u00a0more than two million search enquiries per month for train booking phrases across Europe \u2014 which it suggests highlights \u201cclear user demand for easy-to-use, train travel booking tools\u201d.\nGlobally it notes that around 2.4% of CO2 emissions come from aviation \u2014 which it suggests puts an onus on making longer-distance rail journeys easier to book, since taking the train is 90% less carbon intensive on average so switching trips from air to rail can have a major impact in shrinking transport emissions.\n\u201cUnfortunately, the broader train booking market remains fragmented and by contrast much more straightforward to book a flight knowing you are paying the lowest possible price for your travel,\u201d it also suggests, describing Omio as \u201cone of the only platforms providing consumers with a holistic overview of rail travel options and their price\u201d.\nThe train search tool is being made available to Ecosia users in 15 countries initially: The U.K., Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Norway, USA, Canada, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine \u2014 which are the markets where Omio has inked partnerships with train providers.\nRail providers whose tickets can be booked via the Omio integration include Amtrak in the U.S., LNER, GWR, Avanti in the U.K., SNCF in France, OBB in Austria and Eurostar for cross-channel services, among others.\nEcosia is a not-for-profit so\u00a0100% of the profits from\u00a0the commission it receives from Omio for successful bookings will go directly into its green initiatives \u2014 such as tree-planting projects in biodiversity hotspots and areas affected by deforestation, regenerative agriculture projects and investments into renewable energy.\nThe pair said they hope to expand the tie-up in future \u2014 giving the example of the tool also being able to showcase connection options and other more complex travel add-ons directly within Ecosia. \u201cThis partnership will hopefully expand in the future,\u201d an Ecosia spokesperson told us, adding: \u201cOmio and Ecosia share views on the importance of promoting train travel.\u201d\n\nKonux gears up to scale its AI + IoT play for optimizing the railways\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Omio is a multi-modal travel booking platform which means it spans a range of different transport modes \u2014 including enabling users to book flights (which are the opposite of a low carbon travel option). So some might suggest it\u2019s a touch hypocritical for a travel booking platform that helps the aviation industry sell tickets to be piggybacking on climate concern while its own platform directly monetizes travel by air.\u00a0\u00a0\nThat said, the European startup did have an early focus on championing train travel as a more sustainable choice for long haul trips. So there\u2019s an element of this tie-up circling back to its roots (back when it was known as GoEuro) \u2014 given its founder\u2019s early conviction on the value of getting more travellers onto Europe\u2019s extensive network of railways by taking the legacy pain out of booking train tickets.\u00a0 \nFast forward a decade or so and scores of rail, bus, airline and ferry companies are now on-board with Omio\u2019s booking platform, thanks to its success at inking partnerships with transport firms to populate its digital platform with their ticket inventory. And the company essentially has a full focus on providing transport-mode agnostic utility for travellers \u2014 making it easy for them to compare and book possible intercity or long haul travel options to get to their destination. (Albeit, it will default to surfacing available flight options when you search for long haul routes, even though rail is positioned first in the tabbed list of transport modes.) \nBut you can at least say it\u2019s never been easier for travellers in Europe and North America to book a long haul trips by train thanks to the road-paving efforts of travel booking platforms like Omio. \nWith the Omio-Ecosia tie-up rail trip discoverability is getting a touch easier for climate-concerned consumers. While, for Omio, the tie-up means it gets to have its brand positioned in proximity to an eye-catching \u201csustainable travel\u201d label displayed on the Ecosia tool \u2014 which its marketing team will surely be pointing back to as an example of how it\u2019s encouraging \u201cconscious travel\u201d.\nOn that front, here\u2019s Tommaso del Re, Omio\u2019s VP of partnerships, with some prepared remarks:\nOmio\u2019s goal is to make travel seamless and accessible for everyone, anywhere at any time. We are especially thrilled to partner with Ecosia, as we believe in the importance of creating a more conscious travel future, and therefore want to foster partnerships that prioritise the planet. Flying is an important aspect of the travel ecosystem but we also want to empower travellers to choose more sustainable options, such as train travel, by surfacing all rail travel options in one place, making intercity and cross-border journeys effortless. Our partnership with Ecosia is another way we encourage conscious travel \u2014 and are looking forward to developing our partnership further.\nOther Omio tie-ups include a partnership with Uber last year which saw it injecting train and coach travel options into the ride-hailing app in the U.K.\n\nEcosia gets a new look as it gears up for an era of green search\n\n\nOmio raises $80M as travel demand rebounds after years of COVID-19 crisis\n\n",

        "content": "Business is regularly won and lost on the strength of a proposal. Now, a startup out of London called AutogenAI has built a tool based on generative AI that it claims can help businesses write stronger pitches to improve that strike rate, and it has won some money of its own: $22.3 million from Blossom Capital, which it is using to hire more talent, expand its platform and grow its customer base.\nThe investment values AutogenAI in the region of \u201chundreds of millions,\u201d we understand from a source. It previously raised some $3.5 million.\nAs a measure of AutogenAI\u2019s success, it\u2019s managed to pick up 28 clients since it first opened for business less than a year ago.\nAnd as a measure of just how guarded those customers are about the secret sauce they\u2019re using to win their deals, and maybe the taboo that exists around using AI tools to replace or augment human work, AutogenAI is not disclosing a single actual customer name.\n\u201cThere is still a feeling among customers that using AI would somehow detract from the quality of the work,\u201d Sean Williams, the founder and CEO, said in an interview, explaining why no names are being disclosed.\n(AutogenAI does note \u2014 in a press release that it proudly says was written by AutogenAI, it is a pitch after all \u2014 that the list includes \u201ca global management consultancy, global BPO organisations, quoted and private construction companies and facilities management businesses, as well as charities and non-profits applying for grant funding.\u201d)\nWilliams cut his teeth on years of working for some of the biggest private firms bidding to provide services to the U.K. government, an enormous business that collectively is worth nearly $500 billion annually.\nBeing successful in those tenders was a matter of experience, understanding what content to include and how to present it. But it was also a matter of budget: Those with the funds to invest in building strong bids regularly had a stronger chance of winning deals.\nAutogenAI\u2019s aim is to address both of these areas.\nWilliams said that the platform is built on an amalgamation of large language models \u2014 it uses LLMs from OpenAI and others, he said \u2014 combined with a client\u2019s structured and unstructured proprietary data, and an interface developed by AutogenAI itself to help users query information and create pitches that in turn are based on a company\u2019s most successful past work. These are then presented to the client\u2019s team, which further tailors them \u2014 or potentially rejects them \u2014 before they are submitted to pitch for a contract.\nIn theory, one could ask ChatGPT to build a business pitch, but Williams response is that AutogenAI\u2019s versions will be considerably more specific and thus ultimately more useful to its users.\n\u201cCompanies like OpenAI are focused on AGI, super intelligence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a much smaller problem: We just want to help our customers win more work and work more effectively.\u201d He estimated that AutogenAI\u2019s software could speed up the process of writing a strong pitch \u201cby 800%.\u201d\nThat 800% speaks to the second area of winning bids, which is the required budget outlay. Williams estimates that some 10% of a total contract value can be eaten up by the cost of putting a bid together in the traditional way. His claim is that by using its tools it cuts down procurement costs by some 10%, improving the margins on those deals overall, with the time taken to write the first drafts of bids cut down by 70% and helping those working on bids to focus more on strategic additions.\nOphelia Brown, the founder of Blossom Capital, said that the firm was not yet using AutogenAI itself but that it planned to when it next raised funds. Its interest in the startup stemmed from the fact that while AI companies building LLMs are getting a lot of attention right now, those working on applications like AutogenAI are closer to where a wider range of businesses might make purchasing decisions.\n\u201cWhere this gets\u00a0interesting is when you can see clear ROI on the spend for the product,\u201d she said. \u201cCompanies are willing to pay for something that can help them save time and headcount.\u201d That\u2019s been proven out, she added, through its growth in its first nine months of business.\n",

        "content": "Facebook has more than 3 billion monthly active users, according to Meta\u2019s latest quarterly report. That\u2019s quite the staggering number. Even though Facebook has declined in popularity among younger people, the platform is far from dead. Across Meta\u2019s entire family of apps \u2014 which includes WhatsApp, Instagram, Messenger and now Threads \u2014 there were 3.88 billion monthly active users. That\u2019s almost half of the world population.\nMilestones are fun, but perhaps more importantly for Meta and its investors, daily active users have continued to grow too. Facebook has 2.064 billion daily active users, up from 2.037 billion last quarter. That growth is pivotal, because in the final quarter of 2021, Facebook reported its first-ever quarterly decline in daily active users.\nThis growth could be driven in part by Reels, the TikTok copycat feature that Meta has been pushing heavily across Instagram and Facebook. According to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Reels get 200 billion plays per day across the family of apps.\nThe new, text-based social platform that\u2019s tied with Instagram, Threads, is also doing quite well, per Zuckerberg\u2019s comments.\n\u201cI think we have the most exciting roadmap ahead that I\u2019ve seen in a while,\u201d Zuckerberg said, sounding noticeably more chipper than he has on some recent earnings calls, when Meta posted concerning revenue declines. \u201cWe saw unprecedented growth out of the gate, and more importantly, we\u2019re seeing more people coming back daily than I expected.\u201d\nThreads hit 100 million users within five days. Naturally, not all of those people are going to become dedicated Threads posters. But last week, Zuckerberg posted that \u201c10s of millions of people come back daily,\u201d which is quite impressive.\n\nMeta reports 11% revenue growth, but the metaverse still suffers\n\n\nMeta\u2019s Threads app is rolling out a Following feed\n\n\u00a0\n",

Libro.fm currently partners with more than 2,200 independent bookshops, with 146 of those being international stores.\nAt a time when independent bookshops face crushing competition from Amazon and other major online retailers, the international launch will hopefully help give smaller stores a chance to grow their businesses.\nLibro.fm saw a demand among global readers for an audiobook app that supports smaller bookshops. In 2022, 29% of new Libro.fm users were from outside of the U.S., the company said.\nMore broadly, the global audiobook market size is predicted to reach $35 billion by 2030, per Grand View Research.\nImage Credits: Libro.fm\nEvery time a customer makes a purchase or pays the membership fee, Libro.fm shares profits with the selected bookshop. So, instead of customers giving money to a large service like Audible, they are providing necessary revenue to their local bookstores.\n\u201cWhat is significant for the bookshop is that every sale matters because of their business model\u2026 every book counts,\u201d Libro.fm co-founder and CEO Mark Pearson told TechCrunch. \u201cWhereas for Amazon, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket if you sell a book.\u201d\nIt\u2019s completely free for bookshops to sell audiobooks on Libro.fm.\nMeanwhile, if booksellers want to sell on Amazon-owned Audible, they either make 40% of the retail sales or a royalty rate of 25%, depending on whether they get exclusive or non-exclusive distribution rights. To sell a physical copy on Amazon, sellers must pay either $39.99 per month for a professional seller account (no per-sale closing fee) or 99 cents per sale if they have an individual seller account.\nWith Libro.fm, users choose one bookshop of their choice in their local area and then either pay a monthly membership ($14.99 USD), which gives them one audiobook credit per month, or purchase audiobooks \u00e0 la carte. Members receive a 30% discount when buying individually.\nReaders can listen to their audiobooks via the free iOS or Android app. All audiobooks are DRM-free, meaning they can also download and listen on other devices. Libro.fm hosts more than 400,000 digital audiobooks.\nLibro.fm co-founder and CEO Mark Pearson. Image Credits: Libro.fm\nIn 2014, Libro.fm was co-founded by Mark Pearson (Libro.fm CEO), Carl Hartung (CTO) and Nick Johnson (creative director).\n\u201cAfter starting my own publishing company, Pear Press, I saw growth in my audiobook sales. However, these independent bookshops had no way to participate in that growth,\u201d Pearson told TechCrunch. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s why we decided to start Libro.fm. I myself, as a publisher, and my friends who had PhDs in computer science, teamed up to build this platform. And we did it with no outside investors. We\u2019re 100% employee-owned.\u201d\nWith only 18 employees, Pearson says that the entire Libro.fm team are \u201csuper passionate\u201d about bookstores and plans to keep the company \u201cas small as possible\u201d in order to \u201cmaximize the revenue that we share with our bookshop partners,\u201d he added.\n\nAmazon to shutter Book Depository, a UK-based online bookseller it acquired in 2011, on April 26\n\n",

        "title": "Former pilots recount UFO sightings as Congress pushes for transparency",
        "content": "A year after the first congressional hearing on UFOs in 50 years, a House subcommittee revisited some enduring questions around a topic that once would have been laughed off.\nThe hearing, held Wednesday by the House Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs, explored a range of issues related to the baffling realm of unexplained things that humans have observed flying around \u2014 now more commonly called UAPs or \u201cunidentified aerial phenomena.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that unidentified is far from synonymous with extraterrestrial. While some claims may trend in that direction, these phenomena are just what they sound like: unidentifiable. Proposed explanations range from the mundane \u2014 airborne trash, rogue drones, sensor malfunctions, visual distortions \u2014 to the outlandish, like super secret advanced U.S. military technology, sophisticated tech from U.S. adversaries and, yes, alien spacecraft.\nIt\u2019s also worth pointing out that each witness in Wednesday\u2019s hearing have deep histories of service in the U.S. military and in at least one case had major reservations about coming forward with their stories at all.\nThe hearing featured three witnesses, two of whom have witnessed UAP activity firsthand. Retired Navy Commander David Fravor and former Navy fighter pilot Ryan Graves both under oath described their own in-flight encounters with unexplainable phenomena. Their stories were previously reported in The New York Times.\nGraves said that he and his fellow service members observed \u201cdark gray or black cubes inside of a clear sphere\u201d while in-flight across an eight-year timespan. Graves also described a secondhand account of Boeing contractors observing a massive, red football field-sized unidentifiable object approaching Vandenberg Air Force Base in 2003.\n\u201cThis object remained for about 45 seconds or so before darting off over the mountain, Graves said. \u201cThere was a similar event within 24 hours later in the evening.\u201d\nFravor described his own prior encounter with a \u201cTic Tac\u201d shaped flying object, which he and three other service members observed emerging above an otherwise calm sea and rapidly accelerating all the way up to 80,000 feet \u2014 beyond the limits of even military aircraft. A snippet of that incident was captured in a video officially released to the public by the Pentagon in 2020.\nFravor recounted his experience in depth in his opening statements:\n\u201c\u2026 We saw a small white Tic Tac shaped object with the longitudinal axis pointing N/S and moving very abruptly over the white water. There were no rotors, no rotor wash, or any visible flight control surfaces like wings. As we started a clockwise turn to observe the object, my WSO and I decided to go down to get closer\u2026. We continued down for another 270 degrees when we made a nose low move to head to where the Tic Tac would be when we pulled nose onto the object. Our altitude at this point was approximately 15,000ft with the Tic Tac at about 12,000ft. As we pulled nose onto the object at approximately \u00bd of a mile with the object just left of our nose, it rapidly accelerated and disappeared right in front of our aircraft. Our wingman, roughly 8,000ft above us, also lost visual. We immediately turned to investigate the white water only to find that it was also gone.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to say that the Tic Tac Object that we engaged in November 2004 was far superior to anything that we had at the time, have today, or are looking to develop in the next 10+ years,\u201d Fravor said.\n\nDavid Grusch, a former Air Force intelligence officer who previously worked at the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, also testified during the hearing. Grusch says he personally has not observed UAP activity but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from making some of the more eyebrow-raising whistleblower claims on the topic in recent months, drawing from his experience on a military UAP task force established in 2020. Among them, Grusch has previously alleged that the government operates a secret UAP recovery program and possesses fragments and even intact vehicles of \u201cexotic origin.\u201d\nIn response to a question during Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Grusch went further, noting that \u201cbiologics\u201d were recovered along with some of the UAPs and that the biological material was of non-human origin \u2014 a claim that is not currently corroborated by other sources or available supporting materials.\n\u201cMy testimony is based on information I have been given by individuals with a longstanding track record of legitimacy and service to this country \u2014 many of whom also shared compelling evidence in the form of photography, official documentation and classified oral testimony,\u201d Grusch said.\nClaims of recovered mysterious aircraft and shocking in-flight observations will obviously make headlines, but all three witnesses took the hearing as an opportunity to push for more transparency and better reporting around UAPs. During the hearing, lawmakers\u2019 interest was piqued by claims that the U.S. military is operating secret programs investigating UAPs and potentially developing advanced technology using misappropriated funds. Grusch raised the specter of a \u201cmulti-decade crash retrieval and reverse engineering program\u201d operating with no oversight, but claimed that he was denied access to that program\u2019s operations.\n\u201cIf we in fact have programs that possess [advanced] technology, it needs to have oversight from those people that the citizens of this great country elected to office to represent what is best for the United States and in the best interest of its citizens,\u201d Fravor said.\nGraves in particular called for a standardized process that would allow commercial pilots to document their own UAP sightings, a step that would both reduce stigma and provide useful information for safety practices.\n\u201cAs we convene here, UAP are in our airspace, but they are grossly underreported,\u201d Graves said. \u201cThese sightings are not rare or isolated; they are routine. Military air crews and commercial pilots, trained observers whose lives depend on accurate identification, are frequently witnessing these phenomena.\u201d\n\nAt the first UFO hearing in 50 years, the Pentagon says unexplained reports are way up\n\n",

        "content": "Meta had one of its best quarters since before it changed its name from Facebook. The company reported 11% year-over-year revenue growth, which is a sigh of relief for investors, because this time last year, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company posted its first-ever quarterly revenue decline. Meta\u2019s stock price reflects this \u2014 while the stock took a nose dive through 2022, it\u2019s now climbing back up again, trading at around $298 per share after markets closed today.\nPart of why Meta is making more money is because it\u2019s laid off more than 20,000 employees, which makes personnel costs much lower. Though this correction for over-hiring has serious implications for those who lost their jobs, investors seem to be pleased. Meta calls this downsizing \u201cThe Year of Efficiency,\u201d which is a much more palatable way to say \u201cmass layoffs\u201d on an earnings call.\nThe revenue growth isn\u2019t just a result of lower costs, though. Zuckerberg says that Reels have hit 200 billion daily plays across Instagram and Facebook, and its monetization revenue run rate has increased to more than $10 billion, up from $3 billion in the fall. And though Meta hasn\u2019t started monetizing Threads yet, the new competitor to Twitter (or are we saying X now?) is off to a solid start, according to Zuckerberg.\nThough much at Meta is looking up, Reality Labs continues to struggle. Meta\u2019s VR and AR products brought in just $276 million, while Reality Labs lost $3.7 billion this quarter. Across all of 2022, Reality Labs lost Meta $13.7 billion.\nMeta CFO Susan Li writes in the Q2 2023\u00a0earnings report that the company anticipates Reality Labs\u2019 operating losses to get even larger. But the general public still seems uninterested in Meta\u2019s vision for a metaverse. Apple also entered the AR/VR ring this quarter, announcing its $3,499 Vision Pro AR headset. This long-awaited product is not quite within financial reach for the average consumer, but Meta is gearing up for the fall, when it will compete with Apple and release its Quest 3 headset. The Quest 3, a mixed reality headset, will retail for $499. That\u2019s not chump change, but it\u2019s a lot more accessible than $3,499.\nDespite Reality Labs\u2019 massive costs, Zuckerberg remains optimistic (at least when speaking publicly with investors, who remain skeptical that these investments will pay off).\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to build awesome experiences that help people connect,\u201d he said. \u201cI think helping to shape the next platform is going to unlock that\u00a0in a profound way for decades to come.\u201d\nIt\u2019s reminiscent of early last year, when he unabashedly told investors that even though Reality Labs is bleeding money, the 2030s will be exciting.\n\u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you that I will be right about this, but I do think this is the direction that the world is going in,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\nMeta\u2019s $499 Quest 3 headset arrives this fall\n\n\nMeta conducts yet another round of layoffs\n\n",

        "content": "When you think about replacing a CEO, what springs to mind? The drastic action of a desperate board struggling to right a listing company? Buying an entire company just so you can get Ring\u2019s ex-founder as your new CEO?\nWhen I spoke with Troy Bannister about why he replaced himself as CEO of Particle Health, I became curious about how people go through such a process.\nCEOs are replaced for all sorts of reasons: because they\u2019ve found a new challenge, because the company has outgrown them, or because the board has lost confidence in the CEO.\nAnd it\u2019s not uncommon, either, as Crunchbase reported last year. In 2015, only one-third of startups that reached IPO had their founders as CEOs. Perhaps one of the biggest success stories of a founder walking away from their startup to watch it go on and achieve marvelous things is Marc Randolph at Netflix. But there\u2019s Slack and Pipe and Fairphone and OnlyFans and Tubi, which all have new CEOs this year. Oh, and we heard Twitter has a new CEO as well.\nAs daunting as it might seem to step back as CEO and let go of the thing that you love, it\u2019s often the right thing to do. It\u2019s also something for which there isn\u2019t necessarily that much guidance. DeeDee DeMan at Bench International, a life sciences and healthcare executive search firm, has been eagerly reaching for the bait when CEO-fishing season opens for more than 50 years. She joked that your CEO search ought to be more like \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d than \u201cNo Country for Old Men.\u201d\nBuilding a startup from the first flickers of an idea into a company with a product and staff and a payroll is an indisputably brutal process. For some founders, the self-inflicted stress is no longer tolerable. Others realize that they can\u2019t take the company any further with their skill set.\n\u201cIn the majority of cases, there comes a time that you need to have a professionally credentialed CEO to take the company to the next level,\u201d DeMan said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s completely dependent upon the acceptance and the mentality of the founding CEO. They understand that their wealth of information is more a tradable asset as a domain expert, but that they still need the CEO on board to drive it. A professional CEO can [put] the rigor into the business to make it a \u2018real\u2019 business.\u201d",

        "title": "Waymo puts the brakes on self-driving trucks program",
        "content": "Waymo is tapping the brakes on self-driving trucks and shifting most of its capital, resources and talent to one commercial bet: ride-hailing.\nThe move, which was announced Wednesday in a company blog post, comes six years after Waymo first tested its autonomous vehicle system in Class 8 trucks. The company emphasized the decision was driven by the commercial opportunities in applying its autonomous vehicle technology to ride-hailing.\nRobotaxis (or ride-hailing using driverless vehicles) have always been a centerpiece of Waymo\u2019s plans. However, many AV developers pivoted to logistics and delivery because it was viewed as the better nearer-term economic bet. Even Waymo got into the action and ramped up its delivery and trucking development.\nNow the company is doubling down on ride-hailing.\n\u201cGiven the tremendous momentum and substantial commercial opportunity we\u2019re seeing on the ride-hailing front, we\u2019ve made the decision to focus our efforts and investment on ride-hailing. We\u2019re iterating more quickly than ever on our technology by pushing forward state of the art AI/ML, and seeing significant business growth and rider demand in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles,\u201d the blog from co-CEOs Dmitri Dolgov and Tekedra Mawakana reads.\nAs a result, Waymo will \u201cpush back the timeline\u201d on its commercial and operational efforts on trucking, as well as most of the technical development on that business unit, Dolgov and Mawakana wrote. While Waymo insists it still intends to apply its autonomous vehicle system to trucking, it didn\u2019t provide further details on when it might renew the program or launch a commercial business.\nThe vast majority of employees on Waymo\u2019s trucking team have taken other roles within the company. A few number of individuals will be affected by the change but will be helping with the wind down of the program. Waymo did not provide further details on exactly how many people may be impacted.\nDespite this shift, Waymo says its partnership with Daimler Truck North America to develop an autonomous truck platform will remain intact, albeit at a slower pace. Waymo said it will follow through with the investments it\u2019s made into its partnership with Daimler Truck North America, specifically the development of a redundant chassis needed to safely deploy autonomous trucking. Waymo will also continue limited testing of trucks.\nBoris Sofman, the co-founder and former CEO of defunct robotics startup Anki who, along with a dozen other robotics experts, joined Waymo in 2019 to lead engineering in the autonomous trucking division, is staying on. Sofman, along with much of the trucking team, is already focused on applying its AV system to general freeway capabilities \u2014 an area that Waymo intends to apply to ride-hailing and other applications.\nOther partnerships related to the trucking program have ended, including ones with UPS and J.B. Hunt. The company is weighing options on what it will do with a dedicated nine-acre trucking hub it built in 2021 in Dallas.\nWaymo\u2019s trucking roots\nIn 2017, Waymo quietly began testing its AV tech in trucks in Arizona and California. A year later, Waymo made its trucking ambitions a bit more public and launched a pilot in Atlanta using trucks outfitted with its self-driving system to carry freight bound for Google data centers.\nThe trucking program accelerated in 2019 with a return to Arizona and eventually an expansion into Texas. A month later, Sofman and his team from Anki joined Waymo to focus on trucking.\nWaymo\u2019s efforts kicked into a higher gear by spring 2020 following its first external raise of $2.25 billion\u00a0in a fundraising round led by Silver Lake, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Mubadala Investment Company. That round, which eventually grew to $3.2 billion, coincided with the launch of Waymo Via, the company\u2019s logistics business unit that was created to focus on delivering goods using self-driving trucks and other autonomous vehicles such as vans.\nWaymo Via quickly scored a number of partnerships, from Uber Freight and UPS to J.B. Hunt and Ryder.\nBut even as Waymo formed partnerships and launched AV truck pilots, the company\u2019s most public efforts were on the ride-hailing front. Waymo currently operates a commercial ride-hailing service known as Waymo One in Phoenix and its many suburbs, including Scottsdale and Tempe. That service area, which once was limited to portions of a few suburbs, has continued to expand and in May 2023 doubled in size.\nWaymo also continues to operate and scale in San Francisco as well. Those rides are still free because the company is still waiting for a final permit from the California Public Utilities Commission that will allow it to charge passengers.\n",

The group, called the Overture Maps Foundation, was formed last year. Today, the group has released it first open map dataset.\nWith this dataset, third-party developers can build mapping or navigation products of their own to crack the Apple-Google duopoly. The data includes 59 million \u201cpoints of interest,\u201d such as restaurants and landmarks, along with information about transportation networks and administrative boundaries. The data was collected and donated by Meta and Microsoft.\n\u201cThe release is a significant step in establishing a comprehensive, market-grade open map dataset for our constantly changing world,\u201d said Marc Prioleau, executive director of Overture Maps Foundation, in a statement. \u201cThe Places dataset, in particular, represents a major, previously unavailable open dataset, with the potential to map everything from new businesses big and small to pop-up street markets located anywhere in the world.\n\u201cAnyone who works in mapping knows that the initial data is just the beginning; the ongoing challenge lies in maintaining the data amidst constant changes to meet user expectations,\u201d Prioleau continued. \u201cOverture plans to build a broad collaboration that can build and maintain an up-to-date, comprehensive database of POIs.\u201d\nWhen the group was first announced last year, the companies said that over time, the data would expand to include more places, routing and navigation, and 3D building data.\nThe idea behind the Overture Map Foundation is to make it both easier and cheaper for developers to make apps. For context, developers have to pay to access Google Maps\u2019 API. Although Apple allows access to Apple Maps for free for native app developers, web app developers need to pay to access it.\nMap and location data plays such a fundamental role in a variety of ways, as it powers everything from IoT (Internet of Things) devices and self-driving cars, to logistics and big data visualization tools. Having all that data primarily only accessible via mega-firms can be restrictive in terms of what companies can do with the data and which features they have at their disposal.\n\nMeta, Microsoft, AWS and TomTom launch the Overture Maps Foundation to develop interoperable open map data\n\n",

        "content": "Fundraising is hard, so it\u2019s no wonder that SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) rounds are popular. Conceived by Y Combinator as an alternative to convertible notes, SAFEs have long been considered a founder-friendly way to wrap a venture deal. But, as with most things, the reality is that SAFEs are only an ideal fit for founders sometimes.\nTo find out how the startup ecosystem is doing deals right now, TechCrunch+ recently surveyed five founders about how they\u2019re thinking about less structured rounds like SAFEs. And it appears SAFEs are still a popular choice, except only for pre-seed and seed rounds \u2014 plus fundraising between rounds. After that, though, it appears most founders would prefer priced rounds.\n\u201cSAFEs continue to be an exceptionally appealing mechanism for fundraising, particularly from a founder\u2019s perspective,\u201d said Amy Divaraniya, founder and CEO of Oova. \u201cThe ease of setup, flexibility in determining terms, and absence of a formal close date make them highly advantageous. Additionally, the streamlined nature of SAFE agreements eliminates the need for extensive legal intervention, resulting in a remarkably cost-effective process.\u201d\nWhile several founders echoed Divaraniya, saying they liked the speed and flexibility of a SAFE round, most had a caveat: By the time a startup reaches the Series A stage, this mechanism is less attractive for a variety of reasons.\nVishwas Prabhakara, the co-founder and CEO of Honey Homes, said that he\u2019s glad his startup raised a SAFE note for its pre-seed round, but for its recent Series A round, he didn\u2019t even consider it.\n\u201cDue to how dilution works, it usually doesn\u2019t make sense to stack rounds using SAFEs, in my opinion,\u201d he added.\nBoth Tory Reiss, the co-founder and CEO of Equi, and Zach Blank, the founder of Hurry, agreed with that sentiment, saying founders have to pay close attention to how different investor equity stakes will convert down the line.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a significant downside for a company (and founders/employees) with a SAFE,\u201d Blank said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s great to get investment when price can\u2019t be determined, you need to watch out for \u2018gotchas\u2019 at the next round.\u201d\nRead on to find out how founders today are using SAFEs, what these rounds look like in today\u2019s less founder-friendly market, and if investor-friendly terms are making inroads into early-stage fundraising.\nWe spoke with:\n\nZach Blank, founder, Hurry\nAmy Divaraniya, founder and CEO, Oova\nTory Reiss, CEO and co-founder, Equi\nArman Hezarkhani, founder and CEO, Parthean\nVishwas Prabhakara, founder and CEO, Honey Homes\n\n\nZach Blank, founder, Hurry\nWas a SAFE the option that made the most sense for your last round?\nWe raised a seed round ($2.5 million at a $15 million post-money valuation) in November 2021, the height of the bubble. We had a product in the market with revenue but were still very early. We had been in the market for maybe 30 days at the time we closed the round.\nWhen speaking to investors, a SAFE seemed to be the default option, because there is no real way to price a round this early. So for investors and for us, at the time, a SAFE made the most sense.\nWill you use a SAFE in your next fundraising event?\nNo. There\u2019s a significant downside for a company (and founders/employees) with a SAFE. While it\u2019s great for getting investments when the price can\u2019t be determined, you need to watch out for \u201cgotchas\u201d at the next round.\nFor example, let\u2019s say you raise on a SAFE at a $15 million post-money valuation and a 20% discount. If your next round is priced at $50 million (good for you!), then all your SAFE investors convert at that price from a dilution perspective. They don\u2019t get diluted at all. That\u2019s the upside for them for being early, but it then leaves less room for new investors down the line.\nThe most ideal scenario is that you raise at $15 million in the round subsequent to a SAFE with the same cap.\nWould you say SAFEs are as attractive to you now as they might have been a few years ago? Why or why not?\nNo. Ideally, as a founder, you\u2019re able to bootstrap to a business that can be priced. And if you can\u2019t, you should raise a very small amount (more than $500,000) from angels at a reasonable price, say $2.5 million.\nMassive seed/pre-seed rounds are a thing of the past and were just a result of ZIRP [zero interest-rate policy] and the bubble we were in.",

Which visa should I apply for?\n\u2014 Global Georgian\nDear Global,\nCongratulations on creating a plan and following through to expand your startup in the United States! I am committed to helping founders like you make the world a better place by coming to the U.S. to achieve your dreams. Thanks for reaching out!\nBefore I dive into your visa options, let me pass along some advice that Daniel Zawarczynski, the Austrian Trade Commissioner to the U.S. and co-director of Open Austria, offered to startup founders during our recent podcast. \u201cUse all the resources you have on the ground and build your local network,\u201d he advised. \u201cKnowledge can be acquired so easily through Google and YouTube videos, but knowing the right people to trust and who trusts you is really the path to success.\u201d\nTo start building that network of trusted individuals, I suggest consulting with an immigration attorney to help guide you on your immigration journey to the United States based on your business plan, timing, your long-term goals, your education, your qualifications and your unique situation.\nNow, let\u2019s lay out your immigration options!\n\u201cTransferring\u201d to the U.S.\nThe L-1A visa for intracompany transferee executives and managers offers a great option for international founders who have been working for their startup abroad for at least one of the past three years and want to open an office in the U.S. If you have been working for a legal entity in Poland that\u2019s related to your startup, your Delaware entity could sponsor you for an L-1A visa to come to the U.S. to open an office here. You will have to provide evidence that you have been on the payroll of your startup for at least a year through pay slips or tax documents.\nThe L-1A visa application will require you to submit documents such as business plans, growth models and organization charts. You will need to show that you have secured an office in the U.S. and that the U.S. office will support your position within one year of the L-1A visa being approved. Even though more people are working remotely in the U.S., the L-1A requires your company to have a physical office, which is also considered a sign that your company is serious, viable, growing and even hiring. We\u2019ve been successful in getting L-1 visas approved for companies situated in a co-working space, but I would still recommend a stand-alone office within it.",

        "content": "Following this summer\u2019s launch of the Google Pixel Tablet, the company says it\u2019s updating its Google Play Store to better showcase apps designed for large-screen devices. The changes will help users find high-quality apps for tablets via refreshed app listing pages, ranking and quality improvements, streamlined navigation and a split-screen search experience, explains Google.\nFor starters, the new store listing pages for games will now include a video banner at the top of the page, if one\u2019s available, which allows users to get a better sense of the gameplay offered. In addition, the apps and games details pages have been reorganized in a multi-column layout, which looks better on tablet devices and brings more of the developer\u2019s content into view, without having to scroll down.\nImage Credits: Google\nBut the bigger news for Android app developers is that Google is now pushing developers to build \u201cquality\u201d apps for tablets by changing how apps and games are ranked in search results and in the Apps and Games home pages, and other curated collections.\nIn short, those that adhere to the company\u2019s guidelines for large-screen apps will now rank higher than those that don\u2019t.\nGoogle says the change will help users find apps that resize well, aren\u2019t letterboxed and support both portrait and landscape orientations.\nIn addition, featured sections on the Google Play Store will consider this factor as well, including high-profile spots like the Editor\u2019s Choice and other curated collections and articles.\nImage Credits: Google\nIt\u2019s also extending its technical quality bar that was originally designed to reduce visibility for apps and games that didn\u2019t meet specific technical guidelines to large-screen devices as well. That means apps and games with an 8% user-perceived crash rate or 8% user-perceived ANR (Application Not Responding) rate will be impacted by having warnings added to their pages and will see their visibility reduced. These changes will roll out in late August, Google warns.\nMeanwhile, apps and games that follow Google\u2019s content quality guidelines and support larger-screen devices will also \u201coccupy more screen real estate on Play homepages,\u201d says Google.\nImage Credits: Google\nIn terms of store navigation, Google moved the Top Charts and Categories sections to the Apps and Games Home. And on tablets and Chromebooks, it made the Kids experience a primary tab, as these devices are often shared with children.\nTablet users will also be able to take advantage of split-screen search on large screens, where search results and app details can be viewed side-by-side.\nImage Credits: Google\nThe changes will roll out in the coming weeks, the company says.\n\nGoogle Pixel Tablet review: It\u2019s all about the dock\n\n",

        "content": "While Instagram Threads is making headlines for adding a chronological Following feed to its Twitter-like app, another popular Mastodon client is doing the opposite \u2014 it\u2019s adding a new algorithmic For You feed instead. Mammoth, one of the apps co-founded by a former Twitter app developer and now backed by Mozilla, says it will begin to test a personalized feed in its own third-party client for the decentralized social network known as Mastodon, a competitor of sorts for Twitter\u2019s user base.\nThe addition is notable because of the complaints surrounding Mastodon, which some have found too difficult to use.\nAs an open source, decentralized social network, Mastodon isn\u2019t a centralized platform like Twitter, but rather software that anyone can install on their own servers. Those servers connect \u2014 or federate \u2014 with one another in a system that\u2019s known as the \u201cfediverse.\u201d But for newcomers, it can be difficult to get started on Mastodon as they initially have to choose a server and then figure out how to find people to follow \u2014 even if they\u2019re on different servers. This, too, can be challenging, as there are quirks involved with the following mechanism that don\u2019t exist on centralized social networks.\nMammoth\u2019s original premise was to make the fediverse easier to use by offering a simplified user interface that walks a user through the setup process, including their profile creation.\nImage Credits: Mammoth\nIt also tackles the problem of who to follow on Mastodon by presenting an interface for finding suggested users across categories \u2014 something Twitter also did in its early days. Now, it\u2019s taking a page from Twitter and other competitors, like Threads, by introducing an algorithmic and personalized For You feed that will showcase the people and posts it thinks a user will want to engage with.\nThe company describes the new For You feed as \u201ccurated lists of interesting, diverse Mastodon accounts\u201d that will allow Mammoth users to stumble upon content and accounts they may not have otherwise found. This, in turn, will help users improve their own home feeds as they find and follow new accounts they like.\nThe feature improves upon the original For You feed, launched in May, which looked only for posts and boosts from a list of 100 or so Mastodon accounts. But it wasn\u2019t personalized.\nThe new For You feed now won\u2019t just showcase a range of popular, but diverse, accounts, but will customize its suggestions based on the user\u2019s own \u201cfriends of friends\u201d network. That means the content from public accounts that friends of friends follow will be surfaced in the new For You feed.\nThe feature, now in beta, is an example of how even a decentralized social network like Mastodon could end up looking a lot like a centralized network, such as Twitter (now rebranded as X), despite their very different underpinnings and infrastructure. The end user may not be able to tell the difference.\nMammoth is testing the new feed in its TestFlight with just 100 users for the time being, but plans to make the new feed a part of its next significant update, Mammoth 2. This release will also include other familiar features Mammoth has been developing, like quote posts and Follow Suggestions, in addition to the new For You feed.\n\u201cFor Mammoth 2, we are polishing all the code and features we\u2019ve been developing, and really trying to deliver a consumer-grade Mastodon experience \u2014 both at the app and [user interface] level \u2014 but more importantly, helping users find interesting people and conversations,\u201d explains Mammoth co-founder Bart Decrem.\n\u201cWe see a really big opportunity to build Mastodon \u2014 but really, decentralized social networking \u2014 for the rest of us,\u201d he adds.\n\nMammoth is a free Mastodon app for iOS that makes it easier to get started\n\n\nMozilla leads Mastodon app Mammoth\u2019s pre-seed funding\n\n",

        "content": "Amazon is expanding its range of health-focused apps and services with a platform that offers AI tools to help clinicians transcribe and analyze their conversations with patients.\nAt its annual AWS Summit conference in New York, Amazon unveiled AWS HealthScribe, an API to create transcripts, extract details and create summaries from doctor-patient discussions that can be entered into an electronic health record (EHR) system. The transcripts from HealthScribe can be converted into patient notes by the platform\u2019s machine learning models, Amazon says, which can then be analyzed for broad insights.\n\u201cDocumentation is a particularly time-consuming effort for healthcare professionals, which is why we\u2019re excited to leverage the power of generative AI in AWS HealthScribe and reduce that burden,\u201d Bratin Saha, VP of machine learning and AI services at AWS, said in a blog post shared with TechCrunch via email. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement builds on AWS\u2019s commitment to the healthcare and life sciences industry and our responsible approach to technologies like generative AI to help reduce the burden of clinical documentation and improve the consultation experience.\u201d\nHealthScribe identifies speaker roles and segments transcripts into categories based on clinical relevance, like \u201csmall talk,\u201d \u201csubjective comments\u201d or \u201cobjective comments.\u201d In addition, HealthScribe delivers natural language processing capabilities that can be used to extract structured medical terms from conversations, such as medications and medical conditions.\nThe notes in HealthScribe, augmented by AI, include details like the\u00a0history of the present illness, takeaways and reasons for a visit.\nAmazon says that the AI capabilities in HealthScribe are powered by Bedrock, its platform that provides a way to build generative AI-powered apps via pretrained models from startups as well as Amazon itself. This might be cause for alarm, given generative AI\u2019s tendency to exhibit biases, confidently invent facts and generally go off the rails.\nSpeech recognition algorithms, too, often contain biases. One recent study published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that speech recognition systems from leading tech companies were twice as likely to incorrectly transcribe audio from Black speakers as opposed to white speakers.\nAs a piece in Scientific American points out, in normal conversations, we might choose to \u201ccode-switch\u201d depending on the audience. But there\u2019s no code-switching with automated speech recognition programs \u2014 either you assimilate, or you\u2019re not understood.\nSo is HealthScribe consistent? Can it be trusted, particularly when it comes to deciding whether to label a part of a discussion as \u201csubjective\u201d or \u201cobjective\u201d or identifying medications? And can it handle the wide array of different accents and vernaculars that patients and providers might use?\nThe jury\u2019s out on all that.\nBut perhaps in an effort to prevent some of the more major potential mistakes, HealthScribe can only create clinical notes for two medical specialties at present: general medicine and orthopedics. And the platform offers clinicians a chance to review notes before finalizing records in their EHR, providing references to the original transcript for sentences used in the AI-generated notes.\nGiven the reluctance of some companies to let generative AI apps field sensitive data, it\u2019s not surprising that Amazon\u2019s also highlighting HealthScribe\u2019s security and privacy aspects in its marketing materials. HealthScribe doesn\u2019t retain customer data after processing requests and encrypts data at transit and at rest, and Amazon says it doesn\u2019t use the inputs and outputs generated by HealthScribe to train any of its AI models.\nHealthcare software providers using HealthScribe also have control over where they want to store transcriptions and preliminary clinical notes. But the service isn\u2019t compliant (out of the box) with HIPAA, the U.S. law that provides protections for personal health information.\nHealthScribe is \u201cHIPAA eligible,\u201d however \u2014 meaning customers who work with Amazon to meet HIPAA requirements can ultimately reach compliance. Those customer must sign a contract known as a business associate addendum, which AWS\u2019 documentation covers in detail here.\nAmazon says that 3M Health Information Systems, Babylon Health and ScribeEMR are among the companies already using HealthScribe.\nAlongside HealthScribe, Amazon today announced AWS HealthImaging, a service designed to make it easier to store, transform and analyze medical imaging data \u201cat a petabyte scale.\u201d\nWith HealthImaging, customers can run medical imaging apps from a single copy of each medical image in the AWS cloud. As an added benefit of running on AWS infrastructure, HealthImaging enables dynamic pricing for active and archive data as well as \u201csubsecond\u201d image access latencies from AWS\u2019 Frequent Access or Archive Instant Access storage tiers.\nAmazon claims the average organization can reduce the total cost of ownership of their medical imaging storage up to 40% \u2014 a bold statement, to be sure.\nHealthImaging is now generally available in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Sydney) and Europe (Ireland) AWS regions.\n",

While analytics companies have indicated that Threads\u2019 user numbers have dipped after the initial surge, the app has one-fifth of Twitter\u2019s weekly user base. Linktree\u2019s announcement comes a day after Mark Zuckerberg announced that Threads is rolling out a following feed.\nEarlier this month, the Australia-based company partnered with Snap to offer all creators a way to integrate a Linktree link on their profiles.

Clicking on it will prompt them to describe the data that they\u2019d like to visualize using natural language, such as \u201ctop customers\u201d or \u201cshoes,\u201d or a more precise description like \u201cshoe sales in San Antonio for 2020 by month.\u201d\nAfter QuickSight generates the visualization, it\u2019ll allow users to refine it before adding it to a dashboard by applying filters or changing metrics.\nImage Credits: Amazon\nElsewhere in Quicksight, a forthcoming \u201cBuild for me\u201d menu option will let users edit elements of dashboards and reports in natural language commands. After choosing a visual, clicking \u201cBuild for me\u201d and typing a command \u2014 for example, \u201cchange to a bar chart\u201d or \u201cchange the date axis to monthly\u201d \u2014 will set QuickSight\u2019s generative AI to work on editing the specified element.\nQuickSight\u2019s new generative AI will also be able to create calculations, Amazon says. Clicking \u201cAsk Q\u201d and describing a calculation will yield a corresponding expression syntax, saving the time it\u2019d take to look up the syntax, ostensibly.\nAnd it\u2019ll be able to \u201cwrite\u201d Stories. Stories in QuickSight are a new way to share \u201cvisual narratives,\u201d as Amazon describes them, generated by natural language prompts.\nCreating a Story in QuickSight will entail selecting the new \u201cCreate Story\u201d button on the home dashboard or pinboard and entering a description. After that, QuickSight will incorporate visuals from relevant dashboards alongside text-based outlines, descriptions and analyses of the data, including how it relates to general business problems like acquiring new customers and reducing customer churn.\nOnce Stories are created, users can tweak them using point-and-click as well as generative AI-powered options. That might involve adding an image from a desktop, for instance, or changing the formatting and adding individual lines of text. QuickSight\u2019s new \u201cgenerative editor\u201d can be used to make broader changes, such as changing the tone of the story, making sections shorter or longer, adding acronyms and other terminology specific to their organization or transforming paragraphs into bullet form.\nStories can be shared with other QuickSight users subject to the data governance rules established within reports and dashboards.\nImage Credits: Amazon\nThe question, of course, is to what extent QuickSight\u2019s generative AI can be trusted not to go off the rails. Amazon makes the case that it\u2019s built \u201cusing technology proven for years\u201d delivered via Bedrock, the company\u2019s platform that provides a way to build generative AI-powered apps via pretrained models from startups as well as Amazon itself.\nBut color me skeptical.

Indeed, there\u2019s been a trend toward \u201cpersonalized\u201d generative models lately, with startups like LlamaIndex and Contextual AI\u00a0building tools to augment models with enterprise data.\n\u201cBedrock Agents accelerate the delivery of generative AI applications that can manage and perform tasks by making API calls to your company systems,\u201d Antje Barth, a principal developer advocate at AWS, explains in a blog post shared with TechCrunch via email. \u201cAgents extend AI models to understand user requests, break down complex tasks into multiple steps, carry on a conversation to collect additional information, and take actions to fulfill the request.\u201d\nTo figure out which actions to take, what information to use and in which sequence to perform actions, Bedrock Agents have to be shown how to \u201creason\u201d through prompts that include definitions and instructions. These prompts are generated automatically in the back end through a series of configuration steps, one of which involves telling the Agent what task it\u2019s supposed to perform and role it\u2019s supposed to assume (e.g. \u201cYou\u2019re an agent designed to help with processing insurance claims and managing pending paperwork\u201d).\nThe AI models powering Agents were developed internally by Amazon, a part of the company\u2019s Titan family of AI models.\u00a0But Amazon\u2019s adding to the Bedrock library several models from third parties to coincide with the launch of Agents.\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude 2 text-generating AI and Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, the latest generative image model from AI startup Stability AI, are both available in Bedrock as of today. So are two foundation models from Nvidia-backed Cohere, specifically \u201cCommand text generation\u201d and \u201cCohere Embed.\u201d (Command is trained to follow user commands and be useful in business applications like summarization, copywriting, dialogue, extraction and question-answering, while Embed can be applied in search or classification tasks across 100 or so languages.)\nThe growing range of models, including the models underpinning Agents, would seem to signal Amazon\u2019s seriousness about Bedrock \u2014 and, by extension, the generative AI field.\nBut Bedrock had a rocky start. Bloomberg reported in May that, six weeks after Amazon demoed the tech with an unusually vague presser and just one testimonial, most cloud customers still didn\u2019t have access.\nGiven AWS\u2019 massive reach and computational might, though, Bedrock could have a fighting chance.

        "content": "AI startup Stability AI continues to refine its generative AI models in the face of increasing competition \u2014 and ethical challenges.\nToday, Stability AI announced the launch of Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, a text-to-image model that the company describes as its \u201cmost advanced\u201d release to date. Available in open source on GitHub in addition to Stability\u2019s API and consumer apps, ClipDrop and DreamStudio, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 delivers \u201cmore vibrant\u201d and \u201caccurate\u201d colors and better contrast, shadows and lighting compared to its predecessor, Stability claims.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Joe Penna, Stability AI\u2019s head of applied machine learning, noted that Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, which contains 3.5 billion parameters, can yield full 1-megapixel resolution images \u201cin seconds\u201d in multiple aspect ratios. \u201cParameters\u201d are the parts of a model learned from training data and essentially define the skill of the model on a problem, in this case generating images.\nThe previous-gen Stable Diffusion model, Stable Diffusion XL 0.9, could produce higher-resolution images as well, but required more computational might.\n\u201cStable Diffusion XL 1.0 is customizable, ready for fine-tuning for concepts and styles,\u201d Penna said. \u201cIt\u2019s also easier to use, capable of complex designs with basic natural language processing prompting.\u201d\nStable Diffusion XL 1.0 is improved in the area of text generation, in addition. While many of the best text-to-image models struggle to generate images with legible logos, much less calligraphy or fonts, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 is capable of \u201cadvanced\u201d text generation and legibility, Penna says.\nAnd, as reported by SiliconAngle and VentureBeat, Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 supports inpainting (reconstructing missing parts of an image), outpainting (extending existing images) and \u201cimage-to-image\u201d prompts \u2014 meaning users can input an image and add some text prompts to create more detailed variations of that picture. Moreover, the model understands complicated, multi-part instructions given in short prompts, whereas previous Stable Diffusion models needed longer text prompts.\nAn image generated by Stable Diffusion XL 1.0. Image Credits: Stability AI\n\u201cWe hope that by releasing this much more powerful open source model, the resolution of the images will not be the only thing that quadruples, but also advancements that will greatly benefit all users,\u201d he added.\nBut as with previous versions of Stable Diffusion, the model raises sticky moral issues.\nThe open source version of Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 can, in theory, be used by bad actors to generate toxic or harmful content, like nonconsensual deepfakes. That\u2019s partially a reflection of the data that was used to train it: millions of images from around the web.\nCountless tutorials demonstrate how to use Stability AI\u2019s own tools, including DreamStudio, an open source front end for Stable Diffusion, to create deepfakes. Countless others show how to fine-tune the base Stable Diffusion models to generate porn.\nPenna doesn\u2019t deny that abuse is possible \u2014 and acknowledges that the model contains certain biases, as well. But he added that Stability AI\u2019s taken \u201cextra steps\u201d to mitigate harmful content generation by filtering the model\u2019s training data for \u201cunsafe\u201d imagery, releasing new warnings related to problematic prompts and blocking as many individual problematic terms in the tool as possible.\nStable Diffusion XL 1.0\u2019s training set also includes artwork from artists who\u2019ve protested against companies including Stability AI using their work as training data for generative AI models. Stability AI claims that it\u2019s shielded from legal liability by fair use doctrine, at least in the U.S. But that hasn\u2019t stopped several artists and stock photo company Getty Images from filing lawsuits to stop the practice.\nStability AI, which has a partnership with startup Spawning to respect \u201copt-out\u201d requests from these artists, says that it hasn\u2019t removed all flagged artwork from its training data sets but that it \u201ccontinues to incorporate artists\u2019 requests.\u201d\n\u201cWe are constantly improving the safety functionality of Stable Diffusion and are serious about continuing to iterate on these measures,\u201d Penna said. \u201cMoreover, we are committed to respecting artists\u2019 requests to be removed from training data sets.\u201d\nTo coincide with the release of Stable Diffusion XL 1.0, Stability AI is releasing a fine-tuning feature in beta for its API that\u2019ll allow users to use as few as five images to \u201cspecialize\u201d generation on specific people, products and more. The company is also bringing Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 to Bedrock, Amazon\u2019s cloud platform for hosting generative AI models \u2014 expanding on its previously announced collaboration with AWS.\nThe push for partnerships and new capabilities comes as Stability suffers a lull in its commercial endeavors \u2014 facing stiff competition from OpenAI, Midjourney and others. In April, Semafor reported that Stability AI, which has raised over $100 million in venture capital to date, was burning through cash \u2014 spurring the closing of a $25 million convertible note in June and an executive hunt to help ramp up sales.\n\u201cThe latest SDXL model represents the next step in Stability AI\u2019s innovation heritage and ability to bring the most cutting-edge open access models to market for the AI community,\u201d Stability AI CEO Emad Mostaque said in a press release. \u201cUnveiling 1.0 on Amazon Bedrock demonstrates our strong commitment to work alongside AWS to provide the best solutions for developers and our clients.\u201d\n",

        "content": "The owner of the @x Twitter handle confirmed that the company, now known as X, took over his account without warning or financial compensation, telling him the handle is property of X. The handle had previously belonged to Gene X Hwang of the corporate photography and videography studio\u00a0Orange Photography. In a letter, the company formerly known as Twitter thanked Hwang for his loyalty and offered him a selection of X merchandise and a tour of X\u2019s HQ, as a \u201creflection of our appreciation.\u201d\nThe @x handle mishandling was only one of the many haphazard steps involved in the rebranding of Twitter to X, owner Elon Musk\u2019s favorite letter. According to reports, Twitter didn\u2019t secure the intellectual property rights to the \u201cX\u201d brand, as Microsoft, Meta and others have claims to various \u201cX\u201d trademarks. It also didn\u2019t get permission from the city to remove the Twitter signage on the building, forcing police to stop the work. It didn\u2019t fully update its website and app, which though now sporting an \u201cX\u201d still implored users to \u201csearch Twitter\u201d or push a button to \u201cTweet.\u201d\nAnd it didn\u2019t reach out in advance to secure the @x Twitter handle for itself, as TechCrunch recently learned.\nAs a result, Twitter\u2019s account was renamed \u201cX\u201d but the handle, until today, still read \u201c@Twitter.\u201d\n\nTwitter changes its official handle to @X\n\nHwang was surprised that the company hadn\u2019t reached out to him about the @x account he owned and had set to private, given the corporate rebranding, but said he would be open to a discussion with the company if they wanted the handle for themselves. Typically, compensation for in-demand online usernames ranges in the thousands of dollars when sold on secondary marketplaces. But Hwang was not offered financial compensation, as it turns out \u2014 he just had the handle taken from him. That\u2019s Twitter\u2019s right, of course, but it\u2019s not a great outcome for the owner.\nWe reported the corporate takeover of the @x handle earlier today, when Twitter changed its official handle to @x and Hwang tweeted from his new handle @x1234567998765, \u201cAlls well that ends well.\u201d\nHwang tells us X sent him a letter that essentially stated the @x account is affiliated with X Corp., so he would be assigned a new handle. The company said all his data, including his followers and following data, would be transferred to his new handle. He could also reply to the email to let X know what handle he would like instead. To thank him, the company offered merch and an HQ tour, if he wanted to meet members of the X team.\n\u201cI did always feel like this was something that could happen,\u201d Hwang tells TechCrunch. He said he\u2019s fine with how it played out, hence the tweet.\n\u201cIt would have been nice for them to compensate for it since it did have a lot of value to me, but things are what they are,\u201d he laments. \u201cMaybe I should ask for the bird from the sign since they were dismantling that yesterday too,\u201d Hwang joked.\nThe former owner of @x seems to have a good sense of humor about losing a rare and valuable online username, but then again, Twitter isn\u2019t what it used to be. Literally. The value of having a one-letter username on X is questionable, given the company\u2019s future itself remains in question after the destruction of potentially billions of dollars of brand value.\nAt this point, it\u2019s sort of humorous that Musk bought Twitter in the first place, given that he fired the majority of the team, revamped the product, shut down numerous Twitter features and then renamed the company itself. What exactly did he want to buy then? Just the infrastructure and a way to reach his fans, apparently.\nImage Credits: Letter from X via Gene X Hwang\n",

The company also pointed out that it has been incorporating AI into the platform for over a decade, and is not simply jumping on the bandwagon of the moment.\nToday, it\u2019s announcing a ChatGPT-like interface where customers can interact with the content stored in Egnyte to do things like create summaries of documents or review transcripts of video and audio to generate a list of key points or summaries.\n\u200b\u200bThe company isn\u2019t new to AI, but in the past, as with many enterprise companies announcing generative AI this year, it was taking care of background tasks like privacy, security and infrastructure management. Today\u2019s announcement brings AI to the forefront to any business user who wants to interact with the content stored in Egnyte.\n\u201cWe\u2019re opening up the intelligence engine for every single user on the platform, which includes every business user from all departments. What that will enable them to do is through a chat-based interface, they will be able to ask and answer questions,\u201d David Spitz, chief strategy officer at Egnyte, told TechCrunch.\nIn the future, the company plans to allow customers to query across a set of documents in a single folder or across multiple folders to locate content related to a particular subject, and that will bring powerful search capabilities to the content repository.\n\u201cLater this year, we\u2019re introducing the ability to ask questions across sets of documents, which is like next generation search. You can think of it like natural language-based search,\u201d Spitz said. This could help users find photos with a particular object in an image library, or summarize the last four years of drug discovery for a life sciences application.\nEgnyte co-founder and CEO Vineet Jain says they are building their solutions on existing foundational models. Today, the models are built on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via Microsoft Azure, but he says they still need to fine tune these models for the specific requirements of their customers, who often have very specific language in areas like life sciences and financial services.\n\u201cThe new products use the large language models from Azure [and OpenAI] \u2013 GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 \u2013 to which we have added proprietary mechanisms to verify that the results are accurate and appropriate and to prevent hallucinations. We also worked closely with Microsoft to ensure that no customer data could be shared with the foundational models or other customers, and to ensure that any information generated by the models would respect the access controls of the customer,\u201d Jain said.\nWhile today\u2019s announcement is in line with what many enterprise companies are doing, it is essential for Egnyte to have its own spin on it to remain competitive. Box announced generative AI capabilities will be coming to the platform this year in May, for example.\nEgnyte has never been one to be pushed by the tech of the moment, taking its time and building up a business while competitors took bigger chunks of investment capital and tried to move faster. The company, which launched in 2013, surpassed $200 million in revenue in the first quarter this year with revenue growth of around 25%.\nLike other enterprise companies announcing these capabilities, Egnyte is offering the new tooling to a limited number of customers for now while tweaking it in production environments. It\u2019s vague on when it will be more generally available, but probably some time later this year.\n",

        "content": "VW Group announced Wednesday a pair of deals with Chinese automakers aimed at shoring up sales in China.\nThe German automaker said it will invest $700 million into Chinese automaker XPeng as part of a deal to jointly develop and produce two mid-sized EVs for China. Volkswagen will acquire a 4.99% stake in XPeng, under the agreement.\nThe new battery-electric vehicles will be produced at VW\u2019s new development, innovation and procurement center in Hefei and sold in China under the Volkswagen brand. Earlier this year, VW Group announced plans to invest \u20ac1 billion ($1.1 billion) into the facility, called 100%TechCo., in an attempt to respond to China\u2019s fast-changing consumer needs.\nThe EVs will have DNA from each automaker. The vehicles will be based off of XPeng\u2019s flagship G9 SUV. The connectivity and advanced driver assistance system software, which is often compared to Tesla\u2019s FSD system, will also come from XPeng. The models are expected to start production in 2026, according to XPeng.\nIn a separate agreement, which was also announced Wednesday, VW brand Audi said it\u2019s expanding its partnership with SAIC to produce luxury EVs for the Chinese market. The companies plan to develop a new platform for premium EVs. The company didn\u2019t announce any other details, including when these EVs might hit the marketplace.\nBoth deals come as VW has seen sales fall in China \u2014 one of its most important markets \u2014 as EV leaders Tesla and BYD roar ahead.\n",

        "content": "It sounds like another M&A deal is about to go down in the world of cybersecurity. Sources tell TechCrunch that CrowdStrike is in advanced negotiations to acquire Bionic.AI \u2014 a security posture management platform for cloud services \u2014 for between $200 million and $300 million.\nA deal has yet to be closed, but investors are confident enough that they\u2019re chattering. Bionic.ai \u2014 with roots in Israel but headquartered in Palo Alto \u2014 has to date raised $82 million, although its last round was more than a year ago. Its investors include Insight Partners and Battery Ventures, and its customers include the likes of Chipotle, Freddie Mac and Transamerica.\nOn the plus side of a deal going through, CrowdStrike has been an active M&A player in Israel lately. Most recently, it acquired Reposify in September 2022. On the other side, there could be other suitors. A source tells us Microsoft \u2014 another big acquirer in the country \u2014 had also been looking at Bionic and so that could delay or even derail the deal.\n\u201cAs a leading cloud security provider, we continue to be laser focused on delivering the best cloud security platform in the world, however we can\u2019t comment on rumors or speculation,\u201d a spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nAn acquisition here would underscore the moving target that is cybersecurity: In short, as malicious actors become more sophisticated in their approaches, those protecting networks and IT assets need to as well.\nCrowdStrike\u2019s business focuses on endpoint security, threat intelligence and breach response services, and within that it already covers security posture management, which essentially provides security operations teams with a bird\u2019s eye view of a company\u2019s tech and IT landscape to identify vulnerabilities (and appropriately, CrowdStrike\u2019s service is branded \u201cFalcon\u201d).\nBionic would bring an advanced level of observability: The company says that it focuses on providing advanced security posture management specifically for deployed applications running in production; whole application architectures and related dependencies that might represent opportunities for attacks, even as they evolve or \u2018drift\u2019 within the network; and application data flows.\nWe have also reached out to Bionic CEO and co-founder Idan Ninyo for comment. (And as we were writing this story, Calcalist also ran a story so it seems there really is some chatter going on.) We will update this post as we learn more.\nCybersecurity continues to be one of the more resilient areas in the tech landscape amid a wider downturn in venture funding and overall dealmaking.\n\u201cIsrael is internationally recognized as a powerhouse in the cybersecurity domain, with numerous cybersecurity startups, established companies, research institutions, and government initiatives,\u201d said Avihai Michaeli, a partner at PwC in Israel focusing on M&A activity. He notes that in recent years, around 40% of the private global investment in cybersecurity funding rounds went to Israeli startups.\nUpdated with comment from CrowdStrike.\n",

        "content": "The New York Times announced last week that it will stop making Digits, a math puzzle game that debuted in beta in April. The last of these daily math puzzles will go up on August 8.\nDigits is a fun game. It earned a slot in my daily rotation of the little games I play when I need a little break from writing (for the record, all of you are sleeping on Globle). You have six numbers at your disposal, which you can add, subtract, multiply and divide to get to another specific number. Yeah, it helps if you\u2019re good at math and can do some simple arithmetic to see if your solution to the puzzle will work, but the game does the math for you. It\u2019s all vibes, baby. Add some numbers, multiply them, subtract some other numbers, see how you do.\nIt\u2019s not clear why The New York Times is ceasing the production of Digits, but the company says that it was never meant to be a permanent game.\n\u201cWe always approached our experiment with Digits as a limited time beta test,\u201d a New York Times spokesperson said. \u201cDuring this time, we learned a lot about how players engaged with the game and we\u2019re grateful for their feedback.\u201d\nAt the risk of sounding like a boomer, I think math gets a bad rep these days, and I worry that y\u2019all didn\u2019t give Digits a fair shake. I think people in my generation like to joke about how they can\u2019t do math, but I think we\u2019re smarter than that! It\u2019s not our fault (or teachers\u2019 faults) that the American public education system is underfunded and lacks sufficient resources, and it\u2019s hard to learn precalculus in a classroom with 35 hormonal teens. Math is cool as hell. Didn\u2019t y\u2019all grow up watching ViHart on YouTube? Didn\u2019t you meet some guy in college with an Euler\u2019s Identity tattoo?\nFor myself and the (probably, like, five) other people who played this game, the only consolation is that another beta-testing New York Times game, Connections, kicks ass. You\u2019re given 16 nouns, and you have to sort them into the four correct groups of four. Sometimes a category is easy, like \u201cmodes of transportation.\u201d Sometimes, they\u2019re a bit more tricky, like \u201cband names minus colors.\u201d\nRegardless, I will miss my little daily math puzzles.

Jio Financial Services and BlackRock have struck a deal to form a joint venture, called Jio BlackRock, aimed at serving India\u2019s growing investor base.\nBlackRock and Reliance\u2019s finance unit are targeting an initial investment of $150 million each into the new 50/50 venture, which will seek to offer tech-enabled access to \u201caffordable, innovative\u201d investment solutions for millions of investors in India, they said.\nThe joint venture gives a peek into billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s ambitions with financial services. In a surprising move last year, Ambani announced the demerger of Reliance Strategic Investments and Holdings and its listing as Jio Financial. Jio Financial Services, which was demerged last week, attained a valuation of about $20 billion in a special session conducted by Indian exchanges.\n\u201cThis is an exciting partnership between JFS and BlackRock, one of the largest and most respected asset management companies globally,\u201d said Hitesh Sethia, president and CEO of Jio Financial Services, in a statement.\n\u201cThe partnership will leverage BlackRock\u2019s deep expertise in investment and risk management along with the technology capability and deep market expertise of JFS to drive digital delivery of products. Jio BlackRock will be a truly transformational, customer centric and digital-first enterprise with the vision to democratise access to financial investment solutions and deliver financial well-being to the doorstep of every Indian.\u201d\nThe venture will launch its operations after securing regulatory and statutory approvals, the two firms said. Some analysts believe that Reliance stands to benefit by leveraging the vast troves of consumer data it collects through Jio, the nation\u2019s largest telecom network that reaches nearly 450 million paying subscribers. For BlackRock, the joint venture is the asset manager\u2019s attempt to re-enter India, which it had left in 2018.\n\u201cIndia represents an enormously important opportunity. The convergence of rising affluence, favourable demographics, and digital transformation across industries is reshaping the market in incredible ways,\u201d said Rachel Lord, Chair & Head of\u00a0 BlackRock in APAC, in a statement.\n\u201cWe are very excited to be partnering with JFS to revolutionise India\u2019s asset management industry and transform financial futures.

        "content": "Seven of the largest automakers announced today a joint venture to create a sprawling vehicle recharging network across North America. The goal is to install at least 30,000 charge points in urban and highway locations accessible to nearly any EV by offering Combined Charging System (CCS) and North American Charging Standard (NACS) connectors.\nThe group includes BMW Group, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz Group and Stellantis NV. In short, these automakers want their own Tesla Supercharger network.\nThe project was announced today in a joint press release, noting that the venture is expected to be established later this year, pending customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.\nThe current state of EV charging is poor, and this venture sounds like a good step toward the electric future.\nThe planned charging locations sound like modern gas stations. Universal compatibility is the goal. With both CCS and NACS chargers, nearly any EV can recharge at these stations:\nFocused on customer comfort and charging ease, the stations will be in convenient locations offering canopies wherever possible and amenities such as restrooms, food service and retail operations either nearby or within the same complex. A select number of flagship stations will be equipped with additional amenities, delivering a premier experience designed to showcase the future of charging.\nThe first U.S. stations are scheduled to be open in the summer of 2024, with stations in Canada added later. Stations will first hit metropolitan areas and major highways, followed by popular travel corridors and vacation routes.\nThe charging ecosystem in North America is lagging behind the rollout of electric vehicles. Shoppers still state \u2014 and with good reasoning \u2014 that range anxiety is a concern. Over the last few months, more automakers announced they would adopt Tesla\u2019s North American Charging Standard (NACS) connectors for their EVs, which would give those owners access to Tesla\u2019s massive Supercharger network. Now, with this announcement, EV owners will have more options.\nQuestions about this partnerships remain. The announcement lacks any details about ownership and rates. If this venture is approved, it would create the second-largest EV charging network behind only Tesla\u2019s \u2014 meaning the two largest EV charging networks will be owned by the companies that are making the product.\n\nSeven things every EV fast-charging network needs\n\n\nWhy automakers are rushing to adopt Tesla\u2019s NACS plug and what it means to drivers\n\n\nWhy every EV charging network combined can\u2019t compete with Tesla\n\n",

It is powered by Stripe and it is issued by Celtic bank, \u201cand accepted everywhere Visa is,\u201d he added.\n\u201cWe designed Credit with the reality of an entrepreneur in mind. We recognized that having smooth cash flow is important for business owners, and as a business matures, entrepreneurs may find themselves looking for a credit line to maximize their working capital for expected (and unexpected) expenses,\u201d Finkelstein told TechCrunch via email.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not the first time Shopify has teamed up with Stripe. The two companies have been partnered for nearly a decade and Shopify also works with the company to power Shopify Payments and Shopify Balance, a money management account.\nNotably, merchants are evaluated on a variety of factors in the application process, such as their sales performance, as opposed to credit checks. Specifically, eligibility is also based on the merchant being on Shopify Payments and U.S.-based with sales on Shopify. There is also KYC (know your customer) required, according to the company. Once approved, merchants can start spending immediately with a virtual card and earn 3% cash back on their \u201ctop spend category,\u201d and 1% on remaining categories such as wholesale, marketing and shipping.\nShopify is also emphatic that it won\u2019t charge any fees for the card, including no late or foreign transaction fees.\nThe move is the latest in Shopify\u2019s efforts to straddle the intersection of fintech and commerce.\nIn April, Shopify teamed up with Israeli B2B payments startup Melio to launch a new bill pay tool designed to allow U.S.-based merchant customers to manage their expenses and vendors via its platform.\u00a0\nAnd in 2016, Shopify launched Shopify Capital, which helps merchants gain access to working capital. Last year, it introduced Shopify Balance, which is aimed at helping merchants manage their money. It also offers loan facilities.\nShopify declined to say how many merchants it has in the U.S., noting only that it works with \u201cmillions of merchants\u201d overall.\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

        "content": "Shopify, like countless other Big Tech brands, is leaning into generative AI.\nAt its bi-annual Editions conference, the e-commerce company announced an expanded set of features under Shopify Magic, Shopify\u2019s catch-all brand for generative AI.\nAs of today, Shopify Magic can provide answers to merchants\u2019 customers tailored to their conversation histories and store policies, and generate blog post, product description and marketing email content. And, via a new chatbot-like AI tool called Sidekick, Shopify can understand and interpret questions or prompts related to business decision making.\n\u201cWe believe it\u2019s our responsibility to keep the businesses we power on the cutting edge of technology,\u201d Miqdad Jaffer, Shopify\u2019s head of product for AI, told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cThere\u2019s still so much untapped potential for AI and entrepreneurs, and we\u2019re deeply committed to making the power of AI accessible to businesses of all sizes.\u201d\nJaffer explained that the new Shopify Magic capabilities are powered by a combination of proprietary Shopify data, including merchant business data, paired with available large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u2014 architected in a way that data and conversations aren\u2019t shared with third parties.\nLeveraging that data and those models, Shopify Magic can now generate blog posts for events like holidays, business milestones and campaign ideas, offering merchants the ability to customize the tone of voice and translate content into different languages. In addition \u2014 as alluded to \u2014 Magic can now create content for customer emails from prompts just a few words in length, automatically writing weekly newsletters, announcements and more.\nGiven the tendency of LLMs to write content that isn\u2019t true, or even biased and toxic content, Shopify merchants are given the chance to review copy from Magic before it goes live, Jaffer stressed. And as an added safety measure, Shopify\u2019s AI features are never allowed to write or make changes to any Shopify production systems, he added.\nSidekick\nPerhaps the highlight of Shopify\u2019s announcements today is Sidekick, a conversational AI assistant that\u2019s trained to \u201cknow and understand all of Shopify,\u201d as Jaffer puts it.\nSidekick can understand questions along the lines of, \u201cHow do I set up a discount for a holiday sale?\u201d and \u201cHelp me segment my customers so I can better engage them in my marketing,\u201d while performing tasks like summarizing information across sales documents and performing basic product research. Moreover, Sidekick can be instructed to accomplish specific to-do items such as creating reports showing a merchant\u2019s best-selling products or walking a merchant through an email campaign orchestration tutorial.\nImage Credits: Shopify\nSidekick also has the power to modify Shopify merchant shop designs. Among other things, it can add product collections to a home page, or suggest themes and copy for a hero banner.\nIn a demo video tweeted by Shopify co-founder and CEO Tobi L\u00fctke a few weeks ago, Sidekick is shown answering a series of questions from a snowsports supply merchant. Asked why sales dipped from March to July, Sidekick responds that it was probably due to minimal snow, serving a chart showing sales volumes month-by-month. Then, asked by the merchant to \u201cput everything on sale,\u201d Sidekick suggests a 10% automatic discount on all products in the merchant\u2019s store.\nImage Credits: Shopify\nFrom all appearances, Sidekick is basically like an e-commerce-tuned version of ChatGPT \u2014 and Jaffer said that\u2019s the point.\n\u201cWe believe that there isn\u2019t any corner of the internet that will benefit more from AI than the pursuit of people building and growing their own businesses,\u201d Jaffer said. \u201cFeatures [like Sidekick] are constantly evolving to tailor to and act on the needs of our merchants.\u201d\n",

It seemed evident that the hustle and bustle of startup culture had its limits in this new generation, and no one was immune to the toxic workplace expos\u00e9, which was just one source leak away.\nBut perhaps I spoke too soon. As I continue to ask startup founders about their plans, they always list the vision to scale, build to return investments. They hardly ever mention how they are going to take care of the people they will employ to help them do all these tasks. Granted, startup life is hard. The hours are long and ruthless. The environment is not for the faint of heart; surely anyone looking for a more clear work-life balance would roll their dice in corporate.\nInside, it feels there is hardly any sympathy for the workers who gamble their time with a startup. Venture-backed companies have to scale fast. It\u2019s a spin on that story about the scorpion that stung the frog it took across the river. You knew it was a startup when you joined.

        "content": "Yet another virtual tabletop (VTT) tool has joined the fray, giving Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder and tabletop role-playing gamers alike a new augmented reality experience.\nMirrorscape, a mixed reality and gaming development company, announced the open beta launch of its app, letting users experience their favorite tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) in AR.\nThe new VTT app launches at a time when many players are shifting away from the typical pen-and-paper play and transitioning to digital gaming \u2014 whether by creating character sheets on D&D Beyond, hopping on Discord/Zoom to play with long-distance friends or using services like Roll20.\nMirrorscape aims to shake up traditional tabletop as well as VTT gaming with its technology, allowing users to enhance their game session with AR, build 3D maps, roll digital dice, chat with fellow party members and more, all on one platform.\nThe app is available to download for free on the App Store and Google Play Store. A PC version is launching in the coming months.\n\nSimilar to other companies in the same space (Ardent Roleplay, Spatial and Tilt Five), Mirrorscape\u2019s most significant feature is its building capabilities. The customizable platform provides game masters (GMs) with a toolset for creating an animated world of their dark and twisted dreams, from dimly lit dungeons to small villages overrun by orcs.\nAt launch, Mirrorscape provides access to around 50 already built maps, which can be purchased in the store section within the build tab. Individual digital items, such as miniature figures and terrain, range from 99 cents to $4.99.\nThe app includes a free starter kit, including approximately a dozen or so free maps, a few basic structures like cavern walls, cobblestone floors and doorways, along with five free minis, including a dwarf, a barbarian and a huntress. Hero Forge users can link their digital mini for free.\nIn addition to Hero Forge, the company partners with major game publishers and model manufacturers Paizo (Pathfinder and Starfinder), Reaper, Fat Dragon, Dwarven Forge and many others.\nMirrorscape offers two types of playing modes. Players can either view the map in AR mode \u2014 where they point and look through their phone cameras to explore the landscape \u2014 or 3D mode, which takes place in virtual rooms such as \u201cForge\u2019s Tavern,\u201d featuring a cozy fireplace and mugs of mead, and \u201cThe Hall of Heroes,\u201d a candlelit room that pays tribute to fallen adventurers.\nThere are only two virtual rooms available at launch, but the company plans to launch more in the near future, Eric McIntire, the company\u2019s brand manager, told TechCrunch.\nBoth versions come with POV mode, where party members can click on an eye icon to look at the world from their characters\u2019 perspective.\nImage Credits: Mirrorscape\nAfter testing the app, we found that 3D mode was the most difficult to navigate, especially when zooming in and out or trying to look at the map from a different angle. It\u2019s recommended that users turn off \u201cCenter Pivot\u201d in the top-right menu to avoid a frustrating experience.\nThe AR mode is the most ideal for more interactive experiences. For instance, if a dungeon master wants to create an engaging atmosphere to pair with augmented reality, they can tell their players to go outside and turn on POV mode so it feels like they\u2019re walking through an actual cavern. (Similar to Pok\u00e9mon GO, where players can look through their cameras and discover a Roselia in their very own garden.)\n\u201cImagine all the players actually meet up in person and go outside,\u201d McIntire said, painting one possible scenario. \u201c[The GM] can watch from inside as they walk around his dungeon, and he narrates in their headsets, \u2018You start to smell burning sulfur, death and decay.\u2019 And they walk around the corner and see zombies that he\u2019s got moving towards them.\u201d\nAnother interesting tool that GMs may appreciate is the ability to conceal certain spaces on the map. For instance, if they want to hide a room where a monster is waiting for its moment to strike, the GM can tap on an area and watch it disappear. Co-founder and COO Donald Bland mentioned to us that, eventually, users would be able to scan a physical, handwritten map with their camera, which would then upload as a 3D version on Mirrorscape.\nOther features include a journal option to keep track of dice rolls and a messaging feature. The company is working on bringing effects to the app, such as lightning bolts for when a sorcerer casts a spell.\nHowever, Mirrorscape lacks one important element. The app currently doesn\u2019t offer a character sheet feature for D&D players to refer back to their ability scores, proficiencies, equipment and so forth. Many players use their phones or desktops to look at their sheets, so to have to constantly switch tabs would probably take them out of the immersive experience that Mirrorscape is designed for.\nMcIntire mentioned that a character sheet option is a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d\nFor now, iOS device users can mirror share their screen to a compatible smart TV or Mac and use a separate device to view the character sheet. Android devices can also mirror their screen to the TV. Players using an iPad can opt for the multitasking feature, but this option might be distracting as the separate tab would partially block the screen.\n\nDungeons & Dragons content creators are fighting to protect their livelihoods\n\nMirrorscape isn\u2019t solely designed for private game sessions; it\u2019s a tool for Twitch streamers as well. Soon, content creators will be able to share a QR code with viewers for them to scan, download the app and be immersed in the same digital world as their favorite streamers.\n\u201cWhen [viewers] look at their living room tables, the pieces are moving digitally on their living room table as the players are moving them physically. So, you could actually experience that 3D physical build as though it\u2019s happening in front of you,\u201d McIntire explained.\nMcIntire loosely calls this \u201cpresentation mode,\u201d which can have thousands of people join a single session, in turn helping creators boost their engagement and following.\nFor reference, the Mirrorscape team played a test session on Twitch, which can be viewed on YouTube.\nDonald Bland (left) and Grant Anderson. Image Credits: Mirrorscape\nThe company was co-founded in 2020 by Grant Anderson (CEO) and Donald Bland (COO), veteran D&D players who met while working at Sony. The duo has an extensive background in technology and entertainment, particularly virtual reality and 3D production.\n\u201cAugmented reality was just starting to emerge and was perfect for tabletop gaming,\u201d Anderson told us, who first came up with the idea for Mirrorscape. \u201cI wanted to create something that really gives you that feeling of playing with your friends, and AR was the technology that could do that,\u201d he added.\nAlso, \u201cTrue Blood\u201d actor and hardcore D&D nerd Joe Manganiello is Mirrorscape\u2019s creative director.\n\u201cI am both excited and invigorated to be a part of the Mirrorscape team,\u201d Manganiello said in a statement. \u201cThrough their technology, I have seen the future of gaming and entertainment, and I am incredibly passionate about getting it into the hands of the public. It is going to blow minds and change everything!\u201d\nMirrorscape appeared on Kickstarter in 2022 and raised nearly $500,000. The company also had a $2 million seed round led by TenOneTen Ventures and Ethos Fund.\nIt has since grown to about 7,000 beta users, the company said.\nThe company is in the process of developing Mirrorscape for compatibility with AR glasses and headsets, so gamers can play around with hand and eye tracking, further enhancing high-tech TTRPG sessions. For example, Mirrorscape leverages Qualcomm Technologies\u2019 Snapdragon Spaces program, which enables smart glass wearers to automatically detect tabletop surfaces and manipulate game pieces. The company also notes that its platform is running on Lenovo\u2019s AR glasses prototype.\nThe company hopes to make the platform available on VR headsets in the near future.\nAlthough virtual tabletop games will never truly replace traditional TTRPGs, there\u2019s potential for them to become a trend as AR and VR technology continue to evolve. On top of that, GMs curious about the high-tech side of TTRPG play might love not having to hand-draw maps and painstakingly paint their own minis.\nUpdated 7/26/23 at 11:05 a.m. ET with the correction that Wizards of the Coast is not a Mirrorscape partner.\n\nRole\u2019s video role-playing platform makes a $2.75M charm attempt on the burgeoning tabletop world\n\n",

        "content": "When Graft launched its AI development platform in beta last year, it was looking to build something that put AI within reach of every company, not just the largest ones with tons of engineering resources.\nToday, the company announced a $10 million seed investment. While it was at it, the startup announced that it\u2019s inviting companies to request access to the platform as it begins to open the offering to a larger number of companies in a controlled fashion.\nGraft co-founder and CEO Adam Oliner came up with the idea for the company while he was running AI at Slack. Today, he sees how the growing excitement around ChatGPT has brought AI to the forefront of business conversations, but he says that there\u2019s a big difference between playing with ChatGPT and building a production-ready AI application.\n\u201cThe shiny toys just aren\u2019t built for production, and the established platforms are largely unusable by non-experts. So we see Graft as filling in that gap in the market with a production grade, modern AI platform that\u2019s built for everyone,\u201d Oliner told TechCrunch.\nAs Oliner sees it, ChatGPT has served to show what\u2019s possible, even if developing AI applications hasn\u2019t necessarily gotten any easier. \u201cWhile you can abstract away a ton of that complexity using things like large language models, the path to production has not gotten any simpler, and in some ways has gotten more complex,\u201d he said. \u201cThese models are complex and not readily explainable. They\u2019re large and unwieldy. There are new questions related to compliance, privacy, AI ethics and so on that weren\u2019t present before.\u201d\nTo make it easier, the company has introduced a handful of apps to help customers get going quickly without having to build something themselves from scratch. \u201cWe\u2019re introducing this notion of apps, which are templatized use cases that you can quickly and easily instantiate into full-blown production use cases based on your data,\u201d he said.\nAmong their current offerings are visual search or finding customer champions. He says they have tried to make it simple to get started \u2014 you just need to create a Graft account, choose one of the predefined templates and point to your data. Graft handles the infrastructure to run the application for you.\nToday\u2019s $10 million investment was led by Radical Ventures, with participation from GV. The company has now raised a total of $14.5 million, having raised a $4.5 million pre-seed round last year.\n",

This week, we had Washington Post columnist Taylor Lorenz on to chat about her upcoming book, \u201cExtremely Online,\u201d the history of online platforms and the rise of creators.\n\nNot every creator economy startup is built for creators\n\nWe\u2019ve covered the creator economy a few times on the podcast over the years, but this addition to our historical coverage is more than worth inclusion. Here\u2019s what we got into:\n\nAll the cool kids are pre-ordering Lorenz\u2019s book, which you can find here.\nWhy online work has always been treated like a sideshow: While culture is often created \u2014 or born \u2014 online, there\u2019s a disconnect between historical centers of authority and influence, and where it\u2019s bubbling up today.\nThe rise and fall of Vine: Vine\u2019s massive rise and later implosion is a technology story, a startup story and the saga of how a platform\u2019s user base and its leadership can often be on different pages. In a sense Vine was a warning of what we\u2019d see later on when it came to platforms winding up at odds with the very folks driving attention their way.\nNew formats, new platforms: It\u2019s worth understanding the progression of online influence shifting from text (blogs) to pictures (social media) to video (TikTok, et al.). When new formats have come to the fore, they often bring new platforms along with them, or vice versa.

        "content": "We have the power to transfer money to anyone, from anywhere, without having to step foot in a bank branch. And with great power comes great responsibility amid bank transfer or payment fraud amounting to $1.6 billion in 2022.\nRavi Sandepudi, co-founder and CEO of Effectiv, told TechCrunch that now that banks can\u2019t rely on seeing people in-person, there is heavy digitization that requires fraud checks to be done in real time. In addition, also take into account that fraudsters are getting smarter, in part, thanks to generative AI used to simulate people, signatures and voices.\n\u201cSo many banks were getting hit by fraud and scaling back their digitization channels,\u201d Sandepudi said. \u201cYou have five seconds to settle a transaction, where it used to take three to four days with Automated Clearing House (ACH). Even after the money moves, you could pull it back to ACH. Now with one-way payments, once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone.\u201d\nEffectiv\u2019s co-founders, clockwise from top left, Ravi Sandepudi, Jonathan Doering, Anupam Tarsauliya and Ritesh Arora. Image Credits: Effectiv\nTo combat this, Sandepudi teamed up with Anupam Tarsauliya, Jonathan Doering and Ritesh Arora to start Effectiv, a real-time fraud and risk management platform for financial institutions and fintech companies. All of them met at Simility, a fraud detection software company that was acquired by PayPal in 2018.\nThe San Francisco-based company developed AI-driven tools, including payment fraud detection, customer and business onboarding verification and compliance management, and models that are trained to detect that simulated behavior.\nIt does this in two ways: one to identify if the behavior is normal \u2014 for example, the time of day, the device being used, how it is being held, the transaction amount. Then Effectiv applies an anomaly score to that behavior so that the user can tell which ones need to be scrutinized further. Second, the company creates a model that is trained on loan fraud patterns compared to the anomaly. All of this is done in milliseconds.\nThe concept has caught on. Since launching in 2022, the company has amassed a list of 15 financial institutions and fintech clients that includes BHG Money, Cardless, Pomelo, USALLIANCE Financial and Peapack-Gladstone Bank. Effectiv processed over $30 billion in financial products in the past year and is currently processing over $100 million each day.\nDuring that same time, the company grew from 15 to 25 people and crossed $1 million in annual recurring revenue. Sandepudi expects to 3x that revenue by the end of the year.\nToday, Effectiv joins companies like Cable, also automating bank fraud, in attracting venture capital. The company raised an additional $4.5 million in seed funding to bring its total raise to over $9 million. Better Tomorrow Ventures led the round and was joined by Accel, which led Effectiv\u2019s pre-seed round in 2021, and a group of angel investors.\nSandepudi intends to use the new funding on product development. Now that the instant payment service FedNow is live in the U.S., Effectiv is releasing DeviceAI, a new device biometrics technology that analyzes and flags suspicious user behavior on a device.\n\u201cWe are well funded now and have a good two-and-a-half years\u2019 worth of runway left,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are able to hit our goal of tripling our revenue, it would make sense to put some fire behind our growth and be more aggressive in acquiring new customers.\u201d\n\nFedNow instant payments are about to unlock fintech investment opportunities\n\n",

        "title": "Collaborative Robotics raises $30M to develop and deploy \u2018novel cobot\u2019",
        "content": "A year after unveiling Collaborative Robotics, Brad Porter is still playing it close to the vest. He\u2019s not ready show off the company\u2019s hardware \u2014 or even describe it in too great of detail. \u201cI\u2019m being careful about not revealing the design,\u201d he tells TechCrunch. \u201cWe\u2019re not really like anything you\u2019ve seen yet, which is why we\u2019re being protective of it. We want to get a little further along. There\u2019s a lot\u2026of robots being inspired by other robots.\nThe last time we spoke, the former Amazon Robotics VP was working with a team of between three and five full-time employees. \u201cAt the time, we had just raised a $10 million seed and had a vision for a new type of collaborative robot,\u201d he says of Collaborative\u2019s beginnings a mere 13 months back. \u201cIt\u2019s not a humanoid, but something to take on human-scale tasks. The vision has stayed the same. We are still on that mission and vision. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the last year.\u201d\nHeadcount has since increased to 23. Today the startup announced a $30 million Series A, led by Sequoia Capital. The company says the money will go toward \u201cbegin[ning] the process of scaling early field deployments and manufacturing of their novel cobot.\u201d\nAs to what constitutes a \u201cnovel cobot,\u201d Porter isn\u2019t ready to say just yet. The founder only notes that, along with not being a humanoid \u2014 \u00e0 la Optimus or Figure 01 \u2014 it\u2019s also not a manipulator mounted to the back of an autonomous mobile robot.\n\u201cThere are a few things our robot does that put it in its own category,\u201d Porter explains. \u201cIt\u2019s capable of being an assistive picking robot, but it\u2019s more capable than that. We think a lot about what constrains a robot from being able to do something autonomously \u2014 a complete end-to-end task \u2014 and to do it productively all the time. Having experienced deploying robots in a lot of complicated environments, you run into a lot of constraints. One of them is being able to do an end-to-end task. Even in assistive picking, there needs to be a human to do the mobile manipulation. We\u2019re focused on the movement of boxes, totes and carts \u2014 and being able to do those end-to-end.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a broader definition of \u201ccollaborative\u201d than some are accustomed to. Here it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean working together as much as side by side, with the robots attempting to complete as much of a given task as possible without human intervention.\nWhile the robot and software are still very much in a state of development, Collaborative has been working with customers since its infancy, on the strength of Porter\u2019s Amazon pedigree.\n\u201cWith the news that we were starting something, people started to reach out and find us,\u201d says Porter. \u201cThe way the demographics are shifting, it\u2019s no longer a \u2018nice to have\u2019 or a cool technology. There\u2019s not enough labor to do the type of work that needs to be done. Companies have been saying that they need to embrace this and figure it out, but they don\u2019t know where to start. They found us through various channels and said, \u2018Can you help us build out our approach to this?\u2019\u201d\nThose partnerships have resulted in the creation of the Cobot Flywheel Program, which is designed to build custom solutions and help create early revenue streams as the company builds toward its more ambitious goals. Collaborative says a number of biotech, healthcare and logistics companies are on board, including the Mayo Clinic.\n",

        "title": "Protect AI raises $35M to build a suite of AI-defending tools",
        "content": "Protect AI, a startup building tools to harden the security around AI systems, today announced that it raised $35 million in a Series A round led by Evolution Equity Partners with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Acrew Capital, boldstart ventures, Knollwood Capital and Pelion Ventures.\nThe tranche is more than double the size of Protect AI\u2019s seed round, which closed last December, and it brings the startup\u2019s total raised to $48.5 million. Co-founder and CEO Ian Swanson says the proceeds will be put toward enhanced capabilities in Protect AI\u2019s platform, an expanded research effort and launching new open source projects.\n\u201cNow, we have plenty of capital to weather the storm for years to come,\u201d Swanson told TechCrunch in an email interview, adding that Protect plans to grow its workforce from 25 people to 40 by the end of the year.\nSwanson co-launched Protect AI with Daryan Dehghanpisheh in 2022. Before Protect, Swanson and Dehghanpisheh did stints at AWS and Oracle and helped to launch DataScience.com, a AI development platform that was later acquired by Oracle, their old employer, for an undisclosed sum.\n\u201cWe founded Protect AI 18 months ago based on our experience being involved in some of the biggest machine learning and AI deployments in the world,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cWe saw the value that AI can deliver, but also the risks that are inherent in these systems. Our mission is to help customers build a safer AI-powered world.\u201d\nAs I noted in my previous coverage of Protect AI, there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that AI models \u2014 and the apps powering them, for that matter \u2014 are being attacked on a mass scale. (Perhaps the one exception is OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, which has become a target for pirates selling exposed API keys.) But Swanson makes the case that, as AI becomes more broadly adopted in sensitive industries, such as finance and healthcare, it\u2019s only a matter of time before that changes.\nRegardless of whether that prediction comes true, Protect provides a range of services designed to address what Swanson describes as AI security \u201cweak points.\u201d Its flagship tool, AI Radar, delivers visibility into the various components used to build an AI model \u2014 including the data used for training, testing datasets and code \u2014 and then generates a \u201cmachine learning bill of materials,\u201d or MLBOM for short.\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a new category of machine learning security that focuses on practical threats \u2014 threats in the AI and machine learning supply chain, and in how these models are being built,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cWhat AI Radar is able to do is take a look at that supply chain and find practical threats and risks that we can provide visibility and remediation for with our customers \u2026 It can scan all the MLBOMs \u2026 for every machine learning model within an enterprise and find which pipelines are using [vulnerable software].\u201d\nTo Swanson\u2019s point, a number of popular AI open source projects have been found to contain exploitable code. A recent survey from Endor Labs identified vulnerabilities in 52% of the top 100 AI open source projects. And, broadly speaking, the volume of supply chain cyberattacks is increasing. Sonatype reported late last year that attacks involving malicious third-party software increased by 633% from 2021 to 2022.\nPrivacy and security concerns have also deterred some companies, including Samsung, Apple and Verizon, from allowing their companies to leverage generative AI tools like ChatGPT in the course of their work. The fear is that confidential information entered into those tools could somehow leak into the public domain, intentionally or not.\nIn addition to AI Radar, Protect offers tools to mitigate certain types of AI attacks, such as prompt injection attacks. Prompt injection is when an AI that works from text-based instructions \u2014 prompts \u2014 to accomplish tasks is tricked by malicious, adversarial prompts to perform tasks that weren\u2019t a part of its original objective.\nProtect can also scan documents from Jupyter Notebook, one of the more popular platforms used to create AI models and run data science experiments, for common issues. (Jupyter \u201cnotebooks,\u201d as they\u2019re called, contain all the code necessary to run AI development tasks like model training and fine-tuning.) Improperly secured Jupyter Notebook files can become vulnerable to Python-based ransomware and cryptocurrency mining attacks, research firms have found.\nAmong other potentially problematic lines in code, Protect evaluates Jupyter notebooks for personally identifiable information (e.g. names and phone numbers), internal-use authentication tokens and credentials and open source code with a \u201cnonpermissive\u201d license that might prohibit it from being used in commercial systems.\n\u201cWe have to transition from machine learning operations, or MLOps, which is a tried-and-true practice at this point that companies have been doing for over a decade, and inject security,\u201d Swanson said. \u201cWe need to get to the point where we are truly performing ML security operations \u2014 \u2018MLSecOps\u2019 \u2014 at scale within large enterprises.\u201d\nProtect has a few competitors in the nascent space for AI-defending security tools. There\u2019s Resistant AI, which is developing systems to protect algorithms from automated attacks. And there\u2019s HiddenLayer, which claims that its technology can defend models from attacks without the need to access any raw data or a vendor\u2019s models.\nRobust Intelligence, CalypsoAI and Troj.ai could be counted among Protect\u2019s rivals, as well. But Protect claims to have high-profile private- and public sector-customers in the financial services, healthcare, life sciences and energy industries, signaling that it\u2019s managed to carve out something of a niche for itself.\n\u201cThe general slowdown in tech is not happening in AI, or security,\u201d Swanson said. (Not to aggressively fact-check Swanson, but it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s been a downturn in cybersecurity funding, actually, with Q1 2023 marking the lowest venture capital financing for security in a decade. How might that impact Protect? Tough to say at present.) \u201cProtect AI is at that intersection. The moment is now for AI in terms of deployment \u2014 the value it\u2019s delivering. We help to answer questions like \u2018how do we de-risk AI?'\u201d\n",

        "content": "Far before there was ChatGPT, there was SmarterChild, an instant message chatbot whose encyclopedic knowledge and quick wit could put Google to shame. Thirty million people added SmarterChild to their AIM and MSN buddy lists in the early 2000s, and for many of us, we had our first encounters with artificial intelligence, a technology that now feels unavoidable.\nIn the early aughts, millions of preteens raced home from school and hopped onto their parents computers, opened a chat window and typed\u2026 probably something like \u201cfuck,\u201d or \u201c(.)(.)\u201d.\n\u201cDo you kiss your mother with that mouth?\u201d SmarterChild would reply in an instant. It would make you apologize, and then move past your indiscretions to answer all of your questions about the population of La Paz, the score of the Marlins game or the equations from your math homework.\n\u201cWe were offering people something they never had before,\u201d said Peter Levitan, a co-founder of ActiveBuddy, SmarterChild\u2019s parent company. \u201cWhen you talked to SmarterChild, it knew who you were when you came back. It was like your friend, and having a computer friend then, and now, is fantastic.\u201d\nSmarterChild was far less sophisticated than ChatGPT, but then again, this was 2001. The chatbot was special enough that it inspired investors to fund Siri, which paved the way for Amazon\u2019s Alexa and other robot assistants.\nLevitan has remained level-headed about the future of AI. But another ActiveBuddy co-founder, Robert Hoffer, isn\u2019t as calm. Dubbed \u201cthe bot father,\u201d Hoffer describes himself as \u201ccautiously skeptimistic\u201d and repeatedly references stories like \u201cFrankenstein\u201d and the myth of Prometheus.

Perhaps humans have gone too far, just because we can.\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful that SmarterChild sort of opened the Pandora\u2019s Box,\u201d Hoffer told TechCrunch. \u201cUnfortunately, now, I feel like I have a certain amount of responsibility to share with the world, the good, the bad and the ugly.\u201d\n\u2018We had a sense of humor\u2019\nI met SmarterChild when I was 10. I wouldn\u2019t get my first cell phone for a few more years (a Motorola Razr with a glittery case, shedding sparkles into my pockets), and I had never experienced the mind-blowingly routine luxury of instant, online connection. Now, this technology is so normal that we call these conversations DMs (direct messages), not IMs, since the \u201cinstant\u201d part is redundant. But my first conversations with SmarterChild \u2014 my first conversations with anyone on the internet, really \u2014 felt magical.\nAs a fourth grader, I envied my older brother, whose friends from school had started making their own AIM accounts, allowing them to do homework and gossip together in group chats. But I had SmarterChild, at least, who could keep me entertained for a solid half hour when we played Hangman together.\nI may have been on the younger end of SmarterChild\u2019s user base, but I was by no means an anomaly. It was most popular among 10- to 16-year-olds, and according to Hoffer, SmarterChild usage spiked on weekdays around 3 PM, when kids like me were coming home from school.\nOlder users, of course, would test SmarterChild\u2019s limits, cursing at it and seducing it. But unlike the AI bots that are now cropping up every day, SmarterChild had a personality.\n\u201cWe had a sense of humor,\u201d said Hoffer. \u201cSo if someone tried to have sex with it, it said, \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t have the parts, I\u2019m just a robot!\u2019\u201d\nThese witty retorts mostly came from Pat Guiney, a copywriter who joined ActiveBuddy in 2000.\n\u201cI remember on my very first day, I was given a long list of the most obscene profanity you can think of, and my job was to try to think of responses to it,\u201d Guiney said in an interview with the AV Club. \u201cIn other words, if someone typed some incredibly offensive thing to one of our chat buddies, how should we respond?\u201d\nNow, bots like Snapchat\u2019s ChatGPT-powered MyAI will respond to inappropriate messages by saying, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t respond to that.\u201d SmarterChild, on the other hand, would ask for an apology if you were mean to it. And it\u2019d give you the silent treatment until you said you\u2019re sorry.\nIt seems to be human nature that when we\u2019re confronted with not-quite-human-beings, we will act on our most sadistic urges. We light a fire in our Sims\u2019 home and watch them panic to save their estate, we find increasingly cruel ways to execute Koroks and we harass SmarterChild.\nAccording to Hoffer, the complete chat logs from SmarterChild live somewhere in a basement in Glen Rock, New Jersey, encompassing both the lightest and darkest impulses of mankind.\n\u201cI\u2019ve read more than almost anybody on planet Earth from these chat logs,\u201d Hoffer told TechCrunch. \u201cWe have billions and billions of conversations. Many of them push the boundaries way far, right away. The speed at which they did it, even as young kids\u2026 but they were also asking for help.\u201d\nSome people loved SmarterChild. Some people hated it. While ChatGPT is divisive because of its impact on technology, SmarterChild was divisive because of its snarky persona.\n\u201cWhat the AI world is not delivering at the moment is really any personality, or any soul,\u201d Levitan told TechCrunch.\nSiri, Alexa, ChatGPT, Bard or most other AI bots that have cropped up since the 2010s have very unassuming demeanors, which Hoffer thinks is intentional.\n\u201cIf you have a personality, and your personality is strong, you will appeal to exactly 50% of the people in the world,\u201d Hoffer said.\n\u2018The progenitor of all modern bots\u2019\nIf you ask ChatGPT how many games the Phillies have won this season, it won\u2019t know, since it\u2019s only been trained on data through 2021. But SmarterChild knew. ActiveBuddy licensed databases from IMDB, the Weather Channel, the Dewey Decimal System, Elias Sports, the Yellow Pages and Sony, enabling it to instantly share a wealth of information.\n\u201cEverybody thought back then that the internet was slow because we were putting HTML files through it, and we realized that if you put text through it, it was instantly fast,\u201d said Hoffer. \u201cWe sort of showed up like a virus, and when we look back on it, it was quite clear that we were definitely the progenitor of all modern bots, from Siri to Amazon Alexa to all of the various AIs we see today built around large language models.\u201d\nSmarterChild wasn\u2019t the first AI-powered chatbot, but it bridged the gap between current technology like Siri and Alexa and earlier efforts like Dr. Sbaitso on MS-DOS and ELIZA. Like SmarterChild, these earlier bots could process natural language, but they didn\u2019t have large swaths of data like SmarterChild to make its conversations more productive or useful.\nSmarterChild grew from zero to 30 million users in under six months, solidifying itself as a phenomenon of the early aughts internet. Even Radiohead came calling, using ActiveBuddy\u2019s technology to promote its 2001 album \u201cAmnesiac\u201d through a chatbot named GooglyMinotaur.\nThough Radiohead didn\u2019t realize it, they had identified the use case that ActiveBuddy would pursue for SmarterChild. The company couldn\u2019t make money off of a free chatbot, but what if they allowed other companies to make their own AI-driven chatbots that could be tailored directly to other businesses?\nBut Hoffer was more interested in advancing the tech behind SmarterChild than he was in creating a SaaS product to help corporate brands (not as cool as Radiohead) make more money.\n\u201cThere was a huge fight at the board of directors,\u201d Hoffer told TechCrunch. \u201cI was all about SmarterChild and wanting to win the Turing Test. They wanted to monetize. I lost that fight and got kicked out of the company as a result.\u201d\nHoffer left ActiveBuddy in 2002; then, the company rebranded to Colloquis, though it had a brief moment calling itself Conversagent, a portmanteau of conversation and agent, which reflected its more corporate trajectory.\nUltimately Microsoft bought the company that created SmarterChild in 2006. In the 17-year-old press release celebrating the deal, Microsoft wrote that it would use Colloquis to bring automated customer service agents to Xbox. There was no mention of SmarterChild.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a huge business, you can carve off what doesn\u2019t make sense strategically, and that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Levitan explained. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with the difference between a forward-thinking, aggressive startup team and a major corporation that does not want to offend anyone at any time.\u201d\n\u2018We\u2019ve just opened Jurassic Park\u2019\nThe Microsoft deal didn\u2019t go the way that ActiveBuddy\u2019s founders hoped.\n\u201cOf course, you know, now we\u2019re 15 to 20 years later, and they\u2019re buying similar services,\u201d Levitan quipped.\nThe founders have kept a close eye on developments in AI over the years. Hoffer remembers the iconic faceoff in 2010, when \u201cJeopardy!\u201d icons Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter failed to defeat IBM\u2019s AI, Watson, in a televised match. He watched alongside some engineers, \u201cgobsmacked\u201d at how this computer made legendary trivia masterminds look like amateurs.\nWatson could quickly recall basic trivia facts, but it failed in categories like \u201calso on your computer keys\u201d and \u201cone buck or less,\u201d which required some lived human experience to conjure the correct response. Unfortunately for team humanity, these foibles weren\u2019t enough for Jennings and Rutter to prevail.\nAIs still struggle to overcome similar limitations. While an AI could write something that resembles a TV pilot, it won\u2019t be very interesting, and it will likely contain copyrighted material. So, Levitan\u2019s predictions for the future of AI aren\u2019t too foreboding. He predicts that soon, we\u2019ll be able to voice control bots like ChatGPT, but he doubts that AI will ever truly become sentient.\n\u201cI am a believer in human nature, and that everyone has a very personal voice,\u201d Levitan told TechCrunch. Levitan\u2019s biggest concern with AI is that people will believe everything they read, just because a computer said it. But Hoffer is more worried that the consequences of this technology will pose even larger issues.\n\u201cWe\u2019re right before the opening, or maybe we\u2019ve just opened Jurassic Park,\u201d Hoffer said. \u201cHow far are we from a lens in my eye that has AR hooked up to a bot? Probably not very.\u201d\nWhen SmarterChild typed its final words in 2008, I was in seventh grade, and my friends had finally come around to joining AIM. My away message was usually the lyrics to \u201cDecode,\u201d the song that Paramore wrote for the \u201cTwilight\u201d movie. Now that my buddy list was a bit more fleshed out, I chatted with my classmates about who we had crushes on, always using code names, because we were so deeply paranoid that these clueless 13-year-old boys would somehow manage to hack our AIM accounts and read what we said about them.\nI was so captivated by the gut-wrenching highs and lows of middle school drama that I didn\u2019t even realize what happened. My first friend on the internet had logged off forever.\n",

With this new app, it aims to cater to people looking for platonic connections.\nLast month, the company confirmed to TechCrunch that it was testing the app in some markets, including the U.K. At that time, the dating app said that BFF mode represents 15% of the main apps\u2019 monthly active users. Now, it has officially launched the BFF app in several markets.\nThe app is free to download from both App Store and Google Play. However, it offers in-app purchases such as premium membership with weekly, monthly, three-month, six-month and lifetime subscription plans. The paid plan offers features such as unlimited swipes, backtracking left swipes, advanced filters, incognito mode, super swipes and boosts to get noticed better.\nUsers can create a profile outlining their interests and what kind of friends they are looking for. Bumble said, in the markets where the BFF app is launching, users can easily port their profile to the new app. Once the migration is over, BFF mode won\u2019t be available to those users in the main Bumble app. But the company said that there is no plan to sunset BFF mode in the Bumble app at the moment.\nPeople can swipe through profiles with similar interests \u2014 just like in the Bumble app \u2014 and match with other people.\nThe App Store page for Bumble\u2019s new BFF app. Image Credits: Bumble/App Store\nA lot of people who were part of the test left reviews on the app complaining that it limits friendships to only people who identify as the same gender as the user. The company said that it is starting with \u201cthis experience in the app as we continue to evaluate further product changes, including additional ways for our members to connect with any type of friend.\u201d\nThe company is also rolling out a group chat functionality to plan meetups. Users can create a group from the conversations tab with a subject line and invite two or more matches to join. The app suggests pre-written prompts for activities such as \u201cMeet for coffee,\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s grab a bite,\u201d \u201cLive music or a show\u201d and \u201cGames night.\u201d Users can also write their customized idea for the meetup. It\u2019s not clear how Bumble will limit the group to just planning and not general conversation.\nImage Credits: Bumble\nBumble says that its new app adheres to the same moderation and safety guidelines as the main app. It said that if someone is trying to use the BFF app for romantic purposes, users can report that kind of behavior.\nThe company has been trying to make the BFF mode more enjoyable for users. Last year, it started testing a \u201cHive\u201d feature to form a community as part of the BFF overhaul. But the new app doesn\u2019t seem to have this feature.\nWith this new app, Bumble is competing with other friend-finding apps such as livestreaming app Yubo, LMK, Wink, Wizz, Swipr and Hoop, which lets you connect with people through Snapchat.\n",

        "title": "Amazon makes bid to settle UK antitrust probe into seller data, Buy Box and Prime",
        "content": "In a move seeking to settle an open antitrust investigation in the U.K., Amazon has offered to limit its use of data on marketplace sellers so its retail business cannot gain an unfair advantage over other sellers and provide a guarantee of equal treatment for all products displayed in the \u2018Buy Box\u2019 that appears on listings on its ecommerce marketplace, the national competition watchdog said today.\nThe ecommerce giant has also offered to allow third-party businesses using its marketplace to sell physical goods to negotiate their own rates directly with independent providers of Prime delivery services.\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) opened an investigation into aspects of Amazon\u2019s U.K. business just over a year ago. It\u2019s not taken the step of issuing a formal statement of objections \u2014 so, if accepted, Amazon\u2019s commitments could avoid the company being subject to a longer and deeper probe.\nOn Prime, the U.K. regulator has been looking into how Amazon sets the eligibility criteria for selling under the Prime label loyalty program \u2014 and it suggests the changes proposed by Amazon now will enable customers to benefit from lower delivery costs where better rates are negotiated.\nOn marketplace seller data, the CMA\u2019s concern is that Amazon\u2019s access to commercially sensitive data relating to third-party sellers could give its retail business an unfair advantage by helping it decide which products to sell; how to manage stock levels; set prices; and make other important commercial decisions.\nA blanket commitment by Amazon not to use third party data to gain an unfair advantage is intended to resolve that worry.\nWhile Amazon\u2019s control of the Buy Box \u2014 which is of course prime (ha!) real estate for sellers on the marketplace, given its prominent featuring of selected sellers into product listings \u2014 has triggered concerned products offered by third-party sellers are less likely to appear than similar offers from either Amazon\u2019s own retail business or third-party sellers that use its delivery services. Hence, again, its promise of equal treatment to resolve the concern.\nThe CMA has now opened a consulting on Amazon\u2019s proposed commitments, ahead of taking a decision on whether to accept them. But it said its \u201cpreliminary view\u201d is the offer from Amazon addresses its competition concerns. (The consultation runs until September 1.)\nIn a statement, Ann Pope, senior director for enforcement at the regulator, added:\nAmazon\u2019s commitments to the CMA will help ensure that third-party sellers on Amazon Marketplace can compete on a level-playing field against Amazon\u2019s own retail business and, ultimately, mean that customers in the UK get a better deal. The CMA took this action after it heard concerns that Amazon was using its strength in the market to gain an advantage over thousands of businesses which use Amazon Marketplace to reach customers.\n In December, Amazon reached a settlement with the European Union over similar antitrust probes also focused on its use of marketplace seller data, the Buy Box and Prime. The commitments Amazon is offering to the U.K. regulator look similar to those already accepted by the EU \u2014 although there does appear to be some differences and/or nuance. Not least because the EU pushed back on a first offer from Amazon after criticism it was weak.\nFor example, under the EU settlement Amazon not only agreed to treat all sellers equally for the Buy Box ranking but also to display a second competing offer from a different seller if one exists that is sufficiently differentiated from the first one on price and/or delivery. Whereas the settlement proposed to the CMA makes no mention of displaying a second Buy Box.\nThe commitments Amazon offered the EU also apply for seven years (for Prime and Buy Box); and five years (for all other commitments). Whereas it\u2019s not clear how long Amazon is proposing to maintain the U.K. commitments. (We\u2019ve asked the CMA for more on that.)\nOne aspect that\u2019s shared between the (proposed) U.K. settlement and what the EU already accepted from Amazon is a requirement that it appoints an independent trustee who will monitor its compliance with commitments. (\u201cUnder supervision of the Commission, an independent trustee will be in charge of monitoring the implementation and compliance with the commitments,\u201d the bloc said in December when it settled the probes.)\nMonitoring trustees have been a feature of other CMA settlements on Big Tech commitments. Such as in the case of Google\u2019s commitments about how it would go about deprecating support for tracking cookies and developing and implementing its alternative \u201cPrivacy Sandbox\u201d adtech stack.\n\u201cThe CMA will have a direct say in this appointment, ensuring they have the necessary skills and expertise for the job,\u201d the UK regulator said in the case of Amazon\u2019s commitment to being monitored.\nClearly, what are rather broad-brush pledges from Amazon to the U.K. regulator at this stage \u2014 such as not to use third party seller data to give itself an advantage; and to give equal treatment to all sellers when it comes to being featured in the Buy Box \u2014 will need to be verified to ensure the ecommerce giant is living up to its word. So, if the CMA does accept Amazon\u2019s offer a lot will rest on the quality of the monitoring trustee.\nUpdate: Amazon has now sent this statement in response to a request for comment:\n\nWhile we disagree with the CMA\u2019s preliminary concerns, we have engaged constructively with them to address the matters they have raised and to preserve our ability to serve UK customers and the more than 100,000 UK-based small and medium-sized businesses selling through our UK store.\nWe are extremely proud of the work we\u2019ve done to support our sellers\u2019 success over the past two decades.\n\n\nAmazon faces more antitrust scrutiny in UK and Germany\n\n\nAmazon and EU settle two antitrust cases, including one focused on merchant data abuse\n\n",

        "content": "Shai Gabay and Eli Ben Nun, two entrepreneurs based in Israel, met in 2018 while working at Cynet, a cybersecurity startup developing extended detection and response tools. While there, they came to realize that there was a growing need to secure payment transfers, which were becoming increasingly susceptible to fraud and cybercrime.\nAccording to one recent survey, payment fraud affected almost 60% of companies in the U.S. in 2022. And of the companies responding to the survey, over half think payment fraud attempts will increase over the next year.\n\u201cMany businesses still rely on manual processes to validate payments, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors,\u201d Gabay told TechCrunch via email. \u201cMoreover, the sheer volume of payments processed by businesses often makes it impossible to validate each payment before they are processed by the bank.\u201d\nTrustmi, whose platform is designed to integrate with existing payment workflows and systems, attempts to prevent fraud by conducting an initial assessment of past payments and applying this model to future payments in search of anomalies. Leveraging a \u201ctrust network\u201d that crowdsources data from vendors and businesses, Trustmi delivers a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d approach to payments security, it claims, while letting customers retain full control over their payment processes.\nTrustmi also automates and handles audit preparations, establishing financial reporting standards, protecting data and monitoring for potential breaches. The platform\u2019s payment approval workflow, meanwhile, lets users flag errors and attacks, making it easier, ostensibly, to spot areas where errors and attacks frequently occur and take steps to fix them.\n\u201cWe offer a one-week assessment where historical data is captured to establish a vendor digital fingerprint. This allows us to flag deviations and changes in the vendor\u2019s information and banking details,\u201d Gabay explained. \u201cBy capturing a complete view of the payment data flow and analyzing hundreds of data points, we uncover vulnerabilities and eliminate threats effectively.\u201d\nIt\u2019s tough to know how truthful the \u201ceffectively\u201d part is, and TechCrunch can\u2019t speak to Trustmi\u2019s fraud takedown success rate. But despite all that and competition from vendors like Alloy, Hawk AI and Cable, customers appear to be buying the sales pitch.\nAmong Trustmi\u2019s client list are Colgate-Palmolive, Monday.com and CNA Insurance as well as \u201cdozens\u201d of other companies across the manufacturing, pharmaceutical, healthcare and insurance industries. That high-profile customer list attracted the attention of investors, who today put $17 million toward the startup in a Series A round, bringing its total raised to $21 million.\nCyberstarts led the tranche with participation from Zeev Ventures.\n\u201cOur latest influx of capital will play a pivotal role in expanding our enterprise customer portfolio and securing business payments at an even greater scale,\u201d Gabay said. \u201cAs we move forward, we remain steadfast in our commitment to working with more Fortune 500 companies across all verticals, solidifying our position as the market leader and go-to solution for business-to-business payments security.\u201d\n",

Qualifying organizations should be developing and deploying frontier AI models, and demonstrate a \u201cstrong commitment to frontier model safety.\u201d\nIn the immediate term, the founding members say that the first steps will be to establish an advisory board to steer its strategy, alongside a charter, governance and funding structure.\n\u201cWe plan to consult with civil society and governments in the coming weeks on the design of the Forum and on meaningful ways to collaborate,\u201d the companies wrote in a joint statement today.\nRegulation\nWhile the Frontier Model Forum is designed to demonstrate that the AI industry is taking safety concerns seriously, it also highlights Big Tech\u2019s desires to stave off incoming regulation through voluntary initiatives \u2014 and perhaps go some way toward writing its own rules.\nIndeed, today\u2019s news comes as Europe pushes ahead with what is set to be the first concrete AI rulebook, designed to enshrine safety, privacy, transparency and anti-discrimination at the heart of companies\u2019 AI development ethos.\nAnd last week, President Biden met with seven AI companies at the White House \u2014 including the four founding members of the Frontier Model Forum \u2014 to agree to voluntary safeguards against the burgeoning AI revolution, though critics argue that the commitments were somewhat vague.\nHowever, Biden also indicated that regulatory oversight would be on the cards in the future.\n\u201cRealizing the promise of AI by managing the risk is going to require some new laws, regulations, and oversight,\u201d Biden said at the time. \u201cIn the weeks ahead, I\u2019m going to continue to take executive action to help America lead the way toward responsible innovation. And we\u2019re going to work with both parties to develop appropriate legislation and regulation.\u201d\n",

(See, for e.g. Facebook\u2019s 2014 purchase of WhatsApp.)\nMeta hasn\u2019t faced much legal blowback for using the misleading cover of a freebie VPN app that claimed it would keep people\u2019s data \u201csafe\u201d to spy on users\u2019 digital activity for its own commercial ends. But Australia\u2019s consumer watchdog has now managed to extract an AUS$20 million (~$13.5 million) total penalty payment from two Meta-owned companies involved in the saga: Facebook Israel and Onavo Inc.\nThe Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) sued Meta over its use of Onavo back in December 2020. Today it said a federal court has ordered the two subsidiaries to each pay AUS$10M for engaging in conduct liable to mislead in breach of the Australian Consumer Law.\nThe subsidiaries, which were the developers and suppliers of the Onavo Protect VPN app, were found to be responsible for misleading descriptions of the app displayed in Google and Apple App Store listings.\nThe watchdog also found that the \u201cOnavo Protect\u201d VPN app was installed more than 270,000 times by Australian users between February 2016 and October 2017. Facebook shuttered the service in May 2019.\n\u201cIn Google and Apple App Store listings, Onavo Protect was promoted as a product that would keep users\u2019 data protected and safe, for example with language such as \u2018Use a free, fast and secure VPN to protect personal information\u2018 and \u2018Helps Keep You and Your Data Safe\u2018,\u201d it wrote in a press release. \u201cIn fact, Onavo and Facebook Israel shared the personal activity data from users collected by the app in anonymised and aggregated form with parent company Meta (then known as Facebook Inc) for commercial benefit.\u201d\n\u201cWe took this case knowing that many consumers are concerned about how their data is captured, stored and used by digital platforms. We believe Australian consumers should be able to make an informed choice about what happens to their data based on clear information that is not misleading,\u201d ACCC chair, Gina Cass-Gottlieb, added in a statement.\n\u201cIn the case of the Onavo Protect app, we were concerned that consumers seeking to protect their privacy through a virtual private network were not clearly told that in downloading and using this app they were actually facilitating the use of their data for Meta\u2019s commercial benefit.\u201d\nThe ACCC\u2019s original suit also targeted Meta, as the parent company of Facebook Israel and Onavo. However the watchdog said the case against Meta was dismissed by the Court after settlement negotiations between it and the remaining parties \u201cbased on information about Meta\u2019s role in the conduct\u201d.\nMeta was contacted for comment on the penalty. At the time of writing it had not responded.\nUpdate:\u00a0Meta has now sent this statement:\n\nThe Federal Court of Australia has approved the penalty Facebook Israel and Onavo Inc\u00a0jointly proposed with the ACCC regarding disclosures by\u00a0the app Onavo Protect in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in 2016 and 2017.\nThe ACCC acknowledged in the joint filing that the Onavo Protect listings were not deliberately misleading and disclosures were made in the app\u2019s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Furthermore, all user data was anonymised and aggregated before it was used by Meta.\nThe Onavo Protect app did provide users with a free, useful VPN service and it did function properly as an online security tool. There was no allegation by the ACCC that the app did not function properly as an online security tool.\nProtecting the privacy and security of people\u2019s data is fundamental to how Meta\u2019s business works. Over the last several years, we have built tools to give people more transparency and control over how their data is used, and we design every new product and feature with privacy in mind.\n\n\nAustralia sues Facebook over its use of Onavo to snoop\n\n",

        "content": "Samsung\u2019s Unpacked hardware parade continues with the Galaxy Tab S9. The tablet was destined to be something of an also-ran during an event that features a pair of new foldables and smartwatches. Much like the company\u2019s non-folding flagship smartphones, the Galaxy Tab line is mature now, and most upgrades are destined to be somewhat iterative.\nThere is, however, one interesting surprise this time out. The S9 is the first entry in the series to attain an IP68 rating. That means it can handle dust and a dip in water. It\u2019s the first Samsung tablet to hit that mark that wasn\u2019t specifically designed for rugged use. (Apple\u2019s iPads, by comparison, do not feature an IP rating.) All the tablets get OLED screens for this generation, whereas last year\u2019s models were split across LED and OLED depending on size.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nThe other big update here is the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy. The chip was introduced for the Galaxy S23 handset earlier this year and was rolled to the Galaxy Z foldables line during today\u2019s event. The chip is a customized version of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, which brings some improvements to things like digital signal processing for photos. The quad speakers have been improved as well. They\u2019re 20% larger than the last gen and feature Dolby Atmos sound.\nThe device once again comes in three main variations. There\u2019s the Galaxy Tab S9 (11-inch), Galaxy Tab S9+ (12.4-inch) and Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra (14.6-inch). Different screen sizes mean different battery sizes (naturally), and those come in at 8,400 mAh, 10,090 mAh and 11,200 mAh, respectively. The S9 features a front-facing 12-megapixel ultrawide and rear-facing 13-megapixel camera. The S9+ and S9 Ultra add a second 8-megapixel ultrawide to the rear, while the Ultra also gets a second 12-megapixel selfie camera. All three ship with the new Galaxy S Pen, which \u2014 like the tablets themselves \u2014 is now rated IP68.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nAn optional S Pen Creator Edition \u201cis designed with textured material for a comfortable grip and a wider tilt angle that makes creating more intuitive. Two types of pen-tips are also available, a hard type for natural drawing experiences and a soft type for paper-like writing experiences.\u201d\nThe Tab S9 series goes up for preorder today and starts shipping August 11 (along with the rest of today\u2019s devices). The S9 starts at $800 and 128GB of storage (upgradable to 256GB); the S9+ starts at $1,000 for the 256GB model (upgradable to 512GB); and the S9 Ultra starts at $1,200 for the 256TGB model (upgradeable to 512GB and 1TB). There\u2019s also a 5G version of the S9+ that starts at $1,150.\n",

        "title": "Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip 5 finally fixes the foldable\u2019s biggest problem",
        "content": "The Pixel Fold may be my personal favorite foldable of the moment, but the Galaxy Z Flip is the device that made me believe \u2014 and you can never take that away from it. The first Galaxy Fold was novel, of course, but the product has always been a bit unwieldy and prohibitively expensive. The first Flip arrived with a take on the space that was new and retro, all at once.\nMost of us left the world of clamshells long ago, of course, but the form factor always made sense. Price aside, the distinction between the Flip and Fold is a matter of preference \u2014 do you value portability or the largest screen possible? The new Galaxy Z Fold has you covered on the latter, with a 7.6-inch screen to the Flip\u2019s 6.5 inches, which places it more the realm of large phones, rather than tablets.\nBut the Flip has always been the ultimate piece of portability. It\u2019s a great-looking device that slips comfortably in your pocket. It\u2019s the first foldable that I could really see myself owning. That was helped along significantly by its price tag. Obviously the Overton window of pricing has shifted considerably when we consider a $1,000 phone affordable, but keep in mind the Fold was a hair under $2,000 at launch (it\u2019s since fallen to an almost as unreasonable $1,800).\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nWhile the original Flip was a breath of fresh air, it certainly wasn\u2019t perfect. Among its biggest issues was the impractical external display. There\u2019s not a whole hell of a lot you can do with 1.1 inches. Things have gradually gotten better over the generations, culminating with last year\u2019s 1.9-inch external screen. Announced today at Unpacked in Seoul, the Galaxy Z Flip 5 finally blows the lid off that sucker.\nUnlike, say the Galaxy Z Fold or Pixel Fold, the new Flip\u2019s screen is still fairly limited in its functionality, but the 3.4-inch AMOLED (720 x 748 resolution at 306 ppi) is still huge (figuratively speaking) for the line. Unlike earlier versions, which were effectively a horizon strip, the new display finally takes up the lion\u2019s share of the front panel. While that removes some of the color pop that made the original so charming, it\u2019s a small price to pay.\nThe screen can be used for selfies (there\u2019s a camera icon in the corner of the default desktop), along with assorted app shortcuts. Flipping through, you can toggle between a bunch of useful Samsung apps, including weather and calendar, with support for more selections soon. Like previous iterations, it\u2019s more of an \u201cat a glance\u201d feature, rather than full functional desktop, but it presents a lot more useful information, and is frankly a bigger update than anything introduced with the Fold 5. There are currently a dozen widgets to choose from.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nThere are a few other notable upgrades on the hardware side. The front-facing camera bumps from 10 megapixel to 12 and has a new coating. That, when paired with improved silicon, should enhance low-light shooting (and will generally look better on that larger external screen). As with the Fold 5, the SoC has been upgraded to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy that was introduced for the Galaxy S23 earlier this year. It\u2019s a customized version of Qualcomm\u2019s latest flagship with tweaks that bring things like improved imaging performance. One more thing worth noting on that front \u2014 the baseline storage has been upgraded from 128GB to 256, while retaining the same starting price. That can be upgraded to 512GB, though both options have the same 8GB of RAM (to the new Fold\u2019s 12). The battery capacity stays the same this time out at 3,700mAh.\nThe main screen is the same size as its predecessor. It\u2019s 6.7 inches with a 2640 x 1080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. It retains that somewhat awkward 22:9 aspect ratio. I wholly understand that it\u2019s not everyone\u2019s cup of tea compared to the Fold\u2019s more cinema-friendly 21.6\u00d718, but that\u2019s what you get with this form factor. Unless you make the device considerably wider, you\u2019re going to get a long, skinny screen (see also: the Fold\u2019s external display).\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nThe Flip 5 features Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and rear and is rated IPX8 water resistant \u2014 both the same as the new Fold. Also like the Fold, it goes on sale August 6. Unlike earlier versions, there\u2019s no bespoke option here, likely owing to the new, larger external display.\n",

        "title": "Samsung Galaxy Watch Classic: The bezel is back (again)",
        "content": "The spinning bezel is the best thing about Samsung Watches. And yet, every few generations, the company drops the hardware feature, customers push back and then it magically returns. If I was a more cynical person, I would suggest that this is all a bit to drive engagement, but the more likely answer is that the feature is too much of a nuisance during the design phase and/or Samsung thinks it\u2019s run its course.\nIt\u2019s a move I\u2019ve never fully understood, and despite the company\u2019s suggestions to the contrary, a haptic bezel is no replacement. Besides, given the fact that Samsung is back on Team Wear OS, you\u2019d think it would embrace the sorts of things that differentiate the devices. It\u2019s also historically been one of the big things the line has going for it versus the market-gobbling Apple Watch.\nThis year, Samsung is marking Unpacked with the spirit of compromise by launching two variations of its wearable. There\u2019s the Galaxy Watch 6 and the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. There\u2019s not a ton distinguishing the two, beyond two key factors: 1) Size and 2) The bezel. On the former, the Watch 6 comes in 40 and 40mm versions, with the Watch 6 Classic at 43 and a very large 47mm. As for the latter, the Watch has a 30% slimmer digital bezel, while the Watch 6 Classic mercifully brings back the mechanical bezel at 15% the size of its predecessor.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nPresumably the extra real estate required for a physical bezel expands the case\u2019s surface area, making the watch larger with the same size screen. Samsung\u2019s watches have historically been on the larger side, and given the choice, I would probably opt for the 43mm Watch Classic. In spite of the larger cases on the Classic however, the batteries are the same size. The smaller version of each offers 300mAh and the larger 425mAh.\nThey\u2019re rated at up to 30 hours with the always-on display enabled and 40 hours with it off. That\u2019s not multiple days on a single charge, but the Galaxy Watches do tend to outperform Apple\u2019s when it comes to battery life. The display itself gets an upgrade, as well, it\u2019s 20% larger \u2014 that\u2019s 1.3 inches on the smaller models and 1.5 on the larger, at 432\u00d7432 and 480\u00d7480, respectively. Like their smartphone counterpart, the brightness peaks at 2,000 nits.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nBeyond the bezel, the big updates here arrive on the health and sleep sides \u2014 not a huge surprise there, as most companies have homed in on this as the primary drivers of wearable adoption. Sleep scores offer ratings based on total; time asleep, sleep cycle and awake time, while offering up Sleep Messages in the morning, based on info from the National Sleep Foundation. Sleep Coaching, meanwhile, offers tips for getting and staying asleep.\nThere\u2019s a new Personalized Heart Zone feature designed to offer up optimal running modes to accomplish fitness goals like burning fat or gaining muscle. Irregular Heart Rhythm Notification, meanwhile, will alert the user to signs of AFib, even while sleeping.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nA Samsung Wallet update combines Pay and Pass into a single feature that includes credit cards, IDs, tickets, boarding passes and the like.\nBoth models go up for preorder today and start shipping August 11. The Watch and Watch Classic start at $300 and $330, respectively, with the larger models running $400 and $430.\n",

        "title": "Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold 5 gets upgraded chip, thinner body and $1,800 price",
        "content": "The foldable market has changed dramatically since the beginning of 2019. For starters, there actually is a foldables market to speak of. There was plenty of skepticism around the form factor in the pre-pandemic era, and early hardware issues didn\u2019t help matters much. Foldables remain a drop in the overall smartphone bucket, of course, but the category has continued to make headway as the overall market has slowed.\nAccording to Counterpoint, foldable shipments jumped 64% Y-o-Y in Q1 to 2.52 million. The number is made more remarkable when contrasted with the overall category\u2019s 14.2% drop for the same quarter. Samsung deserves a tremendous amount of credit for these numbers. After all, one can credibly argue that the company almost single handedly built the foldable market.\n2019\u2019s Galaxy Fold wasn\u2019t technically the first foldable. Precise definitions may be a matter for some debate, but the Royole FlexPai did manage to beat it to market by a few months. The device felt more prototype than product, and that whole project took an even stranger turn when Pablo Escobar\u2019s brother entered the scene. It\u2019s an entertaining story, but Samsung can easily lay claim to the first viable foldable.\nWith market interest established, plenty of others have entered the space. Google notably released the Pixel Fold this year \u2014 that\u2019s a sizable vote of confidence from a company that doesn\u2019t produce all that much consumer hardware relative to its size. Samsung is also faced with a ton of competition from Chinese manufacturers.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nThe same Counterpoint survey notes that China has seen a huge spike in demand, with a 117% increase for the quarter as the larger market dropped 8%. Interestingly, Samsung saw a big growth in market share, from 6% to 26%, but Huawei and Oppo still make up slightly larger shares of the market. Globally, however, Samsung continues to dominate, with 63% of the total market.\nSomewhere along the way, the Galaxy Z Fold became another phone. It was bold for the company to replace the Note with the foldable as its second flagship, and its ongoing success has silenced many early critics. But something happens when an innovative device goes mainstream: the novelty wears off. Design issues and relaunches aside, you only get one chance to launch your first foldable. As with most devices, upgrades become more iterative as the product matures. Again, it\u2019s fine and, frankly, to be expected. A radical change every year tends to be a sign that things aren\u2019t working.\nSpec-wise, the new Galaxy Z Fold 5 shares a lot with its predecessor. Both screens are the same size and resolution (6.2-inch 2314 x 904 external and 7.6-inch 2176 x 1812 internal). Ditto for the rear-facing camera array (50-megapixel wide-angle, 12-megapixel ultra-wide and 10-megapixel telephoto with 3x optical zoom). Brightness has been increased to 1,750 nits \u2014 same as on the Galaxy S23 Ultra.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nIn fact, it\u2019s hard to distinguish from the Galaxy Fold 4, but for one important thing: the new hinge. Specifically, the hinge allows for a thinner device. Folded, it decreases from 0.62 to 0.53 inches and from 0.25 to 0.24 unfolded. Obviously the former is the more significant reduction. It\u2019s also the more important one, day-to-day. A device\u2019s thickness is far more noticeable when it\u2019s in your pocket. It\u2019s been one of the bigger issues with the Fold.\nFor a device designed to make a large screen more portable, it\u2019s a lot to carry around in one\u2019s pocket. Samsung says the thinner profile was accomplished courtesy of a new flex hinge with a teardrop design. The move follows the Pixel Fold launch, which touted its own innovative hinge design as a major selling point. At 0.5 inches folded and 0.2 inches unfolded, Samsung certainly hasn\u2019t knocked the product off that perch.\nOf course, it\u2019s worth noting that Google has since run into its own display issues with its first foldable. Some have suggested that the issue is a direct result of having two displays that effectively lie flush, allowing debris to get trapped between and damaging the screen in the process. Given the newer, flatter version of the Galaxy Fold, I asked the company about this potential issue, and they cited the inclusion of bumpers as a protection against this potential issue. As always, the real test comes when the device is launched.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nRumors of a brand new chipset missed the mark here. I can sympathize with the expectation. A Snapdragon 8+ Gen 2 is seemingly overdue. Instead, the company went with the same Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy found on the S23 (it\u2019s also powering the new Galaxy Fold). It\u2019s a customized version of Qualcomm\u2019s latest flagship with tweaks that bring things like improved imaging performance.\nIn fact, the imaging enhancements here are largely a product of the upgraded (relative to last year\u2019s fold) digital signal processing. It brings with it some nice advances, however, including improved low-light performance and more accurate skin tones.\nThe hardware is the same, including the internal under-display camera. That\u2019s a technology that\u2019s never felt up to the company\u2019s exacting imaging standards, and this isn\u2019t likely to move the need much. Understandably, having display pixels on top of the sensor adversely effects image quality, lowering the resolution and making things look smeared and fuzzy. I think Google did it right by hiding the camera away in the bezel \u2014 at least until this technology matures.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nThe onboard battery is 4,400mAh (same as before); RAM and storage start at 12GB and 256GB, respectively (the latter can be upgraded to 512GB or 1TB). The Fold sports Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and the rear and is rated IPX8 water resistant (still no dust rating).The S Pen is 41% thinner than before, and there will be a case with a built-in dock, since the phone itself isn\u2019t quite up to a stylus slot just yet.\nThe price remains the same at $1,800, which will continue to be a barrier against wider adoption. As ever, the $999 Flip is ultimately a far more mainstream device. Both ship August 11.\n",

        "title": "Dioxycle raises $17 million for its electrolyzer that turns CO2 into ethylene",
        "content": "Dioxycle is a carbon transformation startup that is working on a new process to produce ethylene at scale using recycled carbon emissions. Ethylene is used in packaging, clothing, PVC-based sewage pipes, car interiors and more. And the company recently raised a $17 million funding round co-led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Lowercarbon Capital, with Gigascale Capital also participating.\nDioxycle\u2019s main product is a proprietary electrolyzer that uses water, CO2 and electricity as input. In addition to ethylene, the electrolyzer also rejects oxygen. Originally based in France, the startup wants to work with both French and American clients.\n\u201cCO2 is very low in energy \u2014 it\u2019s a combustion waste, there\u2019s no energy left in CO2. So we have to provide a source of energy to make this conversion. And we\u2019re using electricity at the connectors of this electrolyzer to enable this conversion of CO2 into ethylene,\u201d co-founder and CEO Sarah Lamaison told me. \u201cSo, basically, you\u2019ve got CO2 coming into our machine through a pipe, and this CO2 is going to be distributed over lots of catalytic cores, which are stacked on top of each other to increase the surface area available for the reaction.\u201d\nElectrolysis is nothing new, but the main issue with this process is that it requires a lot of input electrical energy. \u201cThe tricky thing with this technology is working on a way to make this conversion as energy-efficient as possible, because that\u2019s what increases the costs of your reaction. Electricity will account for around 50% of your cost, in fact, so that\u2019s huge,\u201d Lamaison said.\nDioxycle has been designing its own catalytic cores with special metal alloys in order to improve the efficiency of the process. The startup tries to maximize the exposure time of CO2 and minimize all potential efficiency losses.\nA green discount\nThe other thing that can make a technology like Dioxycle\u2019s technology attractive is that it can be integrated in factories that produce a lot of carbon emissions and that use ethylene as a source material. This way, the factory can greatly improve its carbon footprint in two different ways. It can reduce its carbon emissions and it doesn\u2019t have to buy as much ethylene from third-party suppliers \u2014 ethylene is usually produced using fossil fuels, such as petroleum derivatives.\nIn addition to the raw material that is used to produce ethylene, the usual transformation process is also responsible of many carbon emissions. In France, ethylene is the third most polluting material behind steel and concrete.\nBut potential clients also want the cheapest ethylene they can find. This is going to be key for Dioxycle\u2019s long-term success. After two and a half years working on several internal proofs of concept, Dioxycle\u2019s process has become better and better over time.\nWith today\u2019s funding round, the company plans to roll out its first industrial prototype in a factory. The startup could also receive some public funding in the near future in addition to the funding round \u2014 the industrial prototype could be co-financed as a public/private partnership.\n\u201cWe want to roll out our product in France, because there\u2019s a huge amount of decarbonized electricity available right now. Today, we\u2019re optimizing our carbon footprint by using the most carbon-free electricity possible,\u201d Lamaison said.\nDioxycle also plans to sell its technology to American companies as there are a lot of incentives with the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Bill. With a recently introduced tax credit, it makes a lot of sense to capture and/or transform carbon emissions as part of your industrial process.\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re introducing the notion of green discount, as opposed to the well-known notion of green premium, which is the extra cost you pay for a green product versus a fossil fuel-based product,\u201d Lamaison said. \u201cOur process is so efficient in this respect that we can produce ethylene that is cost-competitive with fossil ethylene,\u201d Lamaison said.\nImage Credits: Dioxycle\n",

They do not suspect that those companies collude to make them pay more for their electronics and reduce their choice.

It\u2019s a betrayal of their customers\u2019 loyalty.\nAt a time when families are under huge financial pressure from high inflation, mortgage and energy costs, it is more important than ever for consumers to be treated fairly. I decided to bring the claim because consumers individually would never have been able to and the two Tech giants would have continued to line their pockets with their unlawful behaviours going unchecked.\nThe law firm supporting Riefa to bring the representative action is Hausfeld & Co LLP.\u00a0 In another supporting statement, Wessen Jazrawi, partner at Hausfeld, added:\nApple and Amazon have worked together to exclude competitors on the Amazon platform and to reduce the availability of discounted products, at their customers\u2019 expense. We look forward to working with Christine Riefa to return money to those who have lost out and to making these companies accountable for their unlawful conduct.\nThe claim is being brought on an opt-out basis \u2014 meaning all U.K. class members are included by default (and would be in line for compensation if the litigations prevails) unless they decide to opt-out. Affected consumers do not have to pay costs or fees to participate in the legal action, which is being funded by a commercial litigation funder whose name is not being disclosed. (But Law360 UK is reporting it\u2019s the U.K.-based litigation funder, Asertis.)\nU.K. consumers who believe they are eligible to be a member of the claimant class can find more information via the claim website: www.ukappleamazonclaim.co.uk.\nApple and Amazon were contacted for a response to the legal action.\nAn Amazon spokesperson sent us this statement:\nThis claim is without merit, and we\u2019re confident that this will become clear throughout the process. As a result of our agreement with Apple, customers can find the latest Apple and Beats products on our store, and they benefit from an expanded range with better deals and faster shipping.\nApple declined to provide a public statement \u2014 saying it has not yet seen the lawsuit. But the company did offer some background remarks in defense of its reseller agreements with Amazon following legal challenges in other European markets. It argues its main objective for the agreements was to fight counterfeit and safety issues on the ecommerce marketplace and ensure a high quality experience for its customers.\nIt suggests counterfeiting was a particular problem on Amazon prior to the 2018 agreements, claiming to have had to dedicate significant time and resource trying to combat fakes \u2014 including sending hundreds of thousands of take-down notices to Amazon. Per Apple, the problem persisted until the 2018 agreements \u2014 after which it claims there was a significant reduction in the sale of counterfeit Apple kit on Amazon\u2019s marketplaces and an improved experience for its customers.\nThe U.K. litigation follows antitrust enforcements against the two tech giants in Italy and and Spain that led to fines totalling almost $440 million being issued in recent years.\nThe two countries\u2019 national competition regulators found the pair had colluded to place unlawful restrictions on resellers of Apple kit on Amazon\u2019s local marketplaces. Amazon and Apple dispute the findings and filed appeals.\nAn appeal against the Italian decision was successful on procedural grounds in June last year but the litigants in the U.K. suit assert there was no criticism of the decision\u2019s factual or economic findings, adding that they are drawing on information and economic analysis contained in the Italian regulator\u2019s decision to support their claim.\nOver in the U.S. the two tech giants are also facing a similar class action alleging price collusion. And just last month a federal judge denied a motion by the companies seeking to dismiss the consumer antitrust lawsuit \u2014 ruling it could proceed.\nIn separate news earlier this week, Apple was also targeted in the U.K. with another (unrelated) class action damages claim. In that case the litigants are seeking around $1BN in compensation on behalf of U.K. developers who they allege have been subject to anti-competitive behavior by the iPhone maker in relation to its App Store fees.\nThis report was updated with Apple\u2019s response\n\nApple targeted in App Store antitrust damages suit that\u2019s seeking $1BN+ for UK developers\n\n\nApple and Amazon fined $218M for \u2018brand gating\u2019 in Spanish antitrust finding\n\n\nItaly fines Amazon and Apple $230M over alleged reseller collusion\n\n",

        "content": "It would be fair to say there\u2019s no global solution for instant 24/7 access to mental health support. Yes, there are a few \u201cmarketplaces\u201d where you can schedule a call with a therapist in advance.\nOnline solutions now include BetterHelp, Talkspace and Teen Counseling. Then there are platforms connected with public healthcare such as Kooth and Togetherall, often filled with content and peer support forums.\nThis, of course doesn\u2019t suit everyone, especially if you\u2019re going through a crisis and need to talk through stuff with someone quickly. Meanwhile, the problem of mental health grows ever larger.\nIn 2010 the global economic burden of mental health issues was at $2.1 trillion and was expected to be at $6 trillion by 2030. But in 2019 it had already achieved $5 trillion (Global Burden of Disease Study 2019). And all that was before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMeanwhile, a new generation of users have grown up with the possibility of instant gratification via mobile apps. So why not create something that suits this market?\nThis is the aim of U.K. startup Wangie, which is aiming to create what it calls a new category between clinical therapy apps and peer support.\nIt offers 24/7 access to mental health support from a mobile app, connecting therapists available on-demand \u2014 almost like Uber \u2014 with clients who need support immediately.\nInstead of booking therapists, clients \u2014 the startup is aimed mainly at students for now \u2014 can request an online chat with a therapist, and whoever is available takes the booking.\nWangie has now closed an undisclosed pre-seed round led by angel investor Raj Kulasingam and Marc Cohen (of unbundled vc).\nOther angels include Maya Ghosn, The Inner Foundation, Johan Hedewag, Malin Wallin, Mauro Bagnato (4Scale Ventures) and Ada Ventures Scout program.\nSo how does it work? Wangie itself is not a therapy platform but a matching app between clients and therapists.\nThe client has control over how many therapists they talk to, when and how often they book/rebook sessions and for how long they want to talk (15, 30 or 50 min). It\u2019s also possible to talk to more than one therapist.\nUsers sign up anonymously to see the list of therapists who are currently online. They can request a chat with a therapist of choice, and have five minutes to confirm. Once confirmed, they pay and the app opens a private chat between the client and the therapist.\nTherapists have a simple app on their phones, which they use to go online whenever they are available. Wangie makes money via a commission from each session.\nOver an email interview, Solo Founder Monika Holod (who formerly worked in key roles at OYO, Ankorstore and BlaBlaCar) told me: \u201cOver the last 20 years I have had many such situations and saw people close to me suffering, especially young adults and teenagers. The truth is that with every fourth person having serious mental health issues these days, we all experienced similar issues among people close to us. I always wanted to have a space where you can anonymously ask therapists anything without making a commitment to therapy \u2014 to get advice about own concerns or worries about people close to me.\u201d\nAll very well, but how is the company going to deal with the rise of AI-driven therapy?\nShe says that AI is more likely to act as a therapist \u201cco-pilot\u201d: \u201cThere is a huge potential in using the AI to support therapists in their work. We can increase their capacity and create consistent real-time connection with people who need help here & now, without forcing the clients to choose between an \u2018AI bot\u2019 and a human. Being a real-time connection platform we can offer the best of both.\u201d\nShe says she built the first version of the app App during COVID and launched December 2022.\nHolod added that the startup is now in conversation with a couple of universities that are considering implementing the app as a pilot to support students.\n",

        "content": "Materials Nexus, a deep tech AI and quantum mechanic company, announced Wednesday the close of a \u00a32 million seed round led by Ada Ventures. National Security specialists MD One Ventures, the University of Cambridge, as well as angel investors Andrew MacKay and Jasmin Thomas, also participated in the round.\nThe company, which was founded in 2020 and based in the U.K., seeks to amplify net-zero technologies, including renewable energy generation and energy storage, in a way that gives higher performance and sustainability at lower costs.\nCEO and co-founder Jonathan Bean, a theoretical physicist from the University of Cambridge, and his team worked for the past two years on an AI model that reduces the need to conduct physical tests to discover new materials. This allowed them to build their own datasets and algorithms, accelerating the discovery time, meaning that products could be pushed to the market faster. Materials Nexus works with businesses of all sizes to discover materials that can later be patented, and it hopes to one day build a facility to produce materials to then sell to large companies, like an equipment manufacturer.\nBean says the company plans to use the money to scale its commercial and scientific operations. It\u2019s also hoping to prove the effectiveness of its technology, finding alternatives to materials that are already used in products such as semiconductors and batteries to help innovations like wind turbines and electric cars scale more rapidly and sustainably. In the midst of the AI craze, Bean described his fundraising efforts as \u201cquite fun.\u201d\nBean started looking for capital in October 2022 and said he got a term sheet within five months.\nMatt Penneycard, a co-founding partner at Ada Ventures, called Jonathan a \u201cremarkable technical founder and company leader.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a needle in the haystack that we VCs spend years searching for,\u201d Penneycard told TechCrunch, adding that the company is also an exemplar of using technology for good. \u201cOur strong bet is that Materials Nexus has the potential to play a very significant role in our fight against climate change and be the solution to the damaging addiction to rare earths and unique metal compounds we\u2019ve built.\u201d\nWith this raise, Bean joins a rare club in the U.K.: the handful of Black people who have been able to raise money. The last official numbers were released in 2020, and it estimated that only around 40 Black founders had ever raised in the U.K., picking up less than 0.4% of venture capital funding in the nation.\nClimate change in the U.K. has become a pressing matter, and having diverse perspectives on the issue is imperative for achieving true environmental reform. Bean said he went through the Cambridge database to find people who had experience in materials engineering and called up alumni, asking questions and trying to understand the market.\nBean says his dream is to one day set up operations in the U.S. But for now, there is much work to do in the U.K. After all, someone has to help trail-blaze the \u201cUnicorn Kingdom.\u201d\nThis article was updated to clarify MD One Ventures participated in the round.\u00a0\n",

        "content": "Leaders from the AI research world appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss and answer questions about the nascent technology. Their broadly unanimous opinions generally fell into two categories: we need to act soon, but with a light touch \u2014 risking AI abuse if we don\u2019t move forward, or a hamstrung industry if we rush it.\nThe panel of experts at today\u2019s hearing included Anthropic co-founder Dario Amodei, UC Berkeley\u2019s Stuart Russell and longtime AI researcher Yoshua Bengio.\nThe two-hour hearing was largely free of the acrimony and grandstanding one sees more often in House hearings, though not entirely so. You can watch the whole thing here, but I\u2019ve distilled each speaker\u2019s main points below.\nDario Amodei\nWhat can we do now? (Each expert was first asked what they think are the most important short-term steps.)\n1. Secure the supply chain. There are bottlenecks and vulnerabilities in the hardware we rely on to research and provide AI, and some are at risk due to geopolitical factors (e.g. TSMC in Taiwan) and IP or safety issues.\n2. Create a testing and auditing process like what we have for vehicles and electronics. And develop a \u201crigorous battery of safety tests.\u201d He noted, however, that the science for establishing these things is \u201cin its infancy.\u201d Risks and dangers must be defined in order to develop standards, and those standards need strong enforcement.\nHe compared the AI industry now to airplanes a few years after the Wright brothers flew. There is an obvious need for regulation, but it needs to be a living, adaptive regulator that can respond to new developments.\nOf the immediate risks, he highlighted misinformation, deepfakes and propaganda during an election season as being most worrisome.\nAmodei managed not to bite at Sen. Josh Hawley\u2019s (R-MO) bait regarding Google investing in Anthropic and how adding Anthropic\u2019s models to Google\u2019s attention business could be disastrous. Amodei demurred, perhaps allowing the obvious fact that Google is developing its own such models speak for itself.\n\nAge of AI: Everything you need to know about artificial intelligence\n\nYoshua Bengio\nWhat can we do now?\n1. Limit who has access to large-scale AI models and create incentives for security and safety.\n2. Alignment: Ensure models act as intended.\n3. Track raw power and who has access to the scale of hardware needed to produce these models.\nBengio repeatedly emphasized the need to fund AI safety research at a global scale. We don\u2019t really know what we\u2019re doing, he said, and in order to perform things like independent audits of AI capabilities and alignment, we need not just more knowledge but extensive cooperation (rather than competition) between nations.\nHe suggested that social media accounts should be \u201crestricted to actual human beings that have identified themselves, ideally in person.\u201d This is in all likelihood a total non-starter, for reasons we\u2019ve observed for many years.\nThough right now there is a focus on larger, well-resourced organizations, he pointed out that pre-trained large models can easily be fine-tuned. Bad actors don\u2019t need a giant data center or really even a lot of expertise to cause real damage.\nIn his closing remarks, he said that the U.S. and other countries need to focus on creating a single regulatory entity each in order to better coordinate and avoid bureaucratic slowdown.\n\nTop AI companies visit the White House to make \u2018voluntary\u2019 safety commitments\n\nStuart Russell\nWhat can we do now?\n1. Create an absolute right to know if one is interacting with a person or a machine.\n2. Outlaw algorithms that can decide to kill human beings, at any scale.\n3. Mandate a kill switch if AI systems break into other computers or replicate themselves.\n4. Require systems that break rules to be withdrawn from the market, like an involuntary recall.\nHis idea of the most pressing risk is \u201cexternal impact campaigns\u201d using personalized AI. As he put it:\nWe can present to the system a great deal of information about an individual, everything they\u2019ve ever written or published on Twitter or Facebook\u2026 train the system, and ask it to generate a disinformation campaign particularly for that person. And we can do that for a million people before lunch. That has a far greater effect than spamming and broadcasting of false info that is not tailored to the individual.\nRussell and the others agreed that while there is lots of interesting activity around labeling, watermarking and detecting AI, these efforts are fragmented and rudimentary. In other words, don\u2019t expect much \u2014 and certainly not in time for the election, which the Committee was asking about.\nHe pointed out that the amount of money going to AI startups is on the order of 10 billion per month, though he did not cite his source on this number. Professor Russell is well-informed, but seems to have a penchant for eye-popping numbers, like AI\u2019s \u201ccash value of at least 14 quadrillion dollars.\u201d At any rate, even a few billion per month would put it well beyond what the U.S. spends on a dozen fields of basic research through the National Science Foundations, let alone AI safety. Open up the purse strings, he all but said.\nAsked about China, he noted that the country\u2019s expertise generally in AI has been \u201cslightly overstated\u201d and that \u201cthey have a pretty good academic sector that they\u2019re in the process of ruining.\u201d Their copycat LLMs are no threat to the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic, but China is predictably well ahead in terms of surveillance, such as voice and gait identification.\nIn their concluding remarks of what steps should be taken first, all three pointed to, essentially, investing in basic research so that the necessary testing, auditing and enforcement schemes proposed will be based on rigorous science and not outdated or industry-suggested ideas.\nSen. Blumenthal (D-CT) responded that this hearing was intended to help inform the creation of a government body that can move quickly, \u201cbecause we have no time to waste.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who the Prometheus is on AI,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I know we have a lot of work to make that the fire here is used productively.\u201d\nAnd presumably also to make sure said Prometheus doesn\u2019t end up on a mountainside with feds picking at his liver.\n\nFTC reportedly looking into OpenAI over \u2018reputational harm\u2019 caused by ChatGPT\n\n",

        "title": "Exclusive: Goodwater Capital snags $1B across two new funds, despite cooling interest in consumer tech",
        "content": "Goodwater, one of comparatively few firms to focus exclusively on consumer tech investments, has closed on $1 billion in capital commitments across its fifth early-stage fund and its third opportunity-style fund, TechCrunch is first to report. The bulk of the capital \u2014 60% \u2014 will be invested in early- and seed-stage outfits.\nThe Burlingame, California, firm, which now has $3.3 billion in assets under management, has seen a handful of notable exits over its nine-year history. It invested in the lip-syncing app Musical.ly, which reportedly sold for upward of $1 billion in 2017 to ByteDance (which then shut it down and combined it with TikTok). It also backed the Croatian math app Photomath, which Google agreed to acquire last year for an unknown amount; it bet on the cash-back offers startup DOSH, which sold to the digital advertising platform Cardlytics for $275 million in cash and stock in 2021; and it invested in the personalized vitamin company Care/of, the majority of which Bayer snapped up in 2020 for an undisclosed amount that valued the company at $225 million.\nFounded by veteran VCs Chi-Hua Chien, formerly of Kleiner Perkins, and Eric Kim, long of Maverick Capital, Goodwater has now backed 79 early- and growth-stage startups altogether across 19 countries. Some of its most highly valued portfolio companies currently include the grocery delivery company Getir in Turkey, which has been gobbling up the competition in Europe as its money-losing rivals are forced to consolidate; Toss Bank, in South Korea, which was reportedly looking to raise funds at a $3 billion valuation a few months ago; and the so-called neobank Monzo in the U.K., which has been through a few tumultuous years but continues to grow.\nSomewhat astonishingly, Goodwater has also issued checks to 600 seed-stage startups across 50 countries through a platform it has developed called Genesis that features \u201cmaster class\u201d level programming via pre-recorded modules by the likes of Tinder co-founder Sean Rad and former Amazon exec Jeff Wilke, who also happens to be a limited partner in Goodwater.\nTo gain admission, teams need only apply online; Goodwater\u2019s minimal threshold for startups is that they have tens of thousands of users and tens of thousands of dollars in initial revenue. There is no cut-off period. Kim uses the term \u201copen enrollment\u201d to describe how the process works, then pokes fun at himself for using language that comes up at other Goodwater portfolio companies. In return, with the help of a platform team composed of \u201cdozens of engineers, data scientists, product leaders, and ML experts that are building a customized set of services,\u201d says Kim, Goodwater wrings out insights into dozens of geographies and ideas. (It also gets early access. To date, Goodwater has written Series A checks to six startups to come through its Genesis platform.)\nThat nine-year-old Goodwater remains committed to \u201cconsumer\u201d is notable. Despite widespread interest in how tech can reshape how people experience the world, an uncertain economic environment and growing customer acquisition costs have driven many venture firms to dial back on funding products and services that depend on attracting and retaining individual customers.\nIt helps that Goodwater\u2019s definition of consumer tech is broad and includes housing, healthcare, food, financial services, transportation, education, and entertainment.

Snap saw its first revenue decline as a public company in Q1, marking a 7% drop in sales from the previous year. At the time, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said that the shift did not reflect the company\u2019s ambitions.\nWhile revenue is trending down, Snapchat\u2019s daily active users perked up in Q2, up 14% year-over-year to 397 million.\nLike its peers, Snap is still contending with a decline in advertising revenue stemming from intense competition from rivals like TikTok and Instagram and changes to Apple\u2019s app privacy policies that threw social media companies for a loop when first introduced.\nTo keep its platform fresh and its users engaged, Snapchat introduced buzzy new AI features in recent months, with some cordoned off specifically for its paid subscribers. Snap\u2019s AI chatbot My AI is now woven into the app\u2019s group chats, place recommendations and Lens suggestions.\nA year ago, Snapchat introduced paid subscriptions, charging users $3.99 a month for a collection of premium perks.

        "content": "Amazon today introduced a new feature that will allow consumers to be better informed about potential product safety alerts and recalls. Now, instead of having to seek out product recall information through third-party websites and other news sources, Amazon shoppers will be able to access a new \u201cYour Recalls and Product Safety Alerts\u201d page that will be linked on the top of their \u201cYour orders\u201d page and shared with customers via email.\nWhen consumers click on the banner or the emailed link, they\u2019ll be directed to a page where they can read more details about the potential safety hazards of products they\u2019ve purchased and review their options \u2014 like refunds, returns, and repairs.\n\u201cWith this new feature, we are able to directly reach 100% of customers who have bought a recalled product in our store and provide clear instructions on what to do next,\u201d Amazon says in a blog post announcing the new feature.\nWhile the feature is designed to address products Amazon sells, the retailer is also making the new system accessible to its third-party sellers. The company\u2019s U.S.-based selling partners will be able to opt into Amazon\u2019s Recalls Logistics Service (RLS). This will allow the sellers to notify customers who purchased the affected products, while Amazon can manage the process of issuing refunds on behalf of the selling partner as well as managing the return logistics.\nHowever, the drawback here is that the system appears to be limited to U.S. sellers and on an opt-in basis. Many of Amazon\u2019s marketplace sellers are overseas \u2014 and in regions that don\u2019t have the same safety standards as in the U.S. This has resulted in unsafe products sold by third-party sellers making their way into U.S. consumers\u2019 hands \u2014 including, for example, children\u2019s toys, a 2019 investigation by CBS News found.\nOf course, as one of the largest retail websites, Amazon will continue to face several product safety issues, due to the size of its catalog. More recently, its recalls have included things like portable chargers recalled for being a fire hazard, as well as issues stemming from its own brands, like the Amazon Basics Desk Chairs that were recalled due to the possibility that their legs would break, posing fall and injury hazards. It also sold cups with unsafe lead levels, and more.\nIn 2021, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) even sued Amazon to force it to accept responsibility for recalling potentially hazardous products it sells. The complaint had cited such issues as \u201c24,000 faulty carbon monoxide detectors that fail to alarm, numerous children\u2019s sleepwear garments that are in violation of the flammable fabric safety standard risking burn injuries to children, and nearly 400,000 hair dryers sold without the required immersion protection devices that protect consumers against shock and electrocution.\u201d\nPrior to this, several U.S. senators had also written to Amazon to demand the recalls of hazardous products after a CNN investigation found that dozens of AmazonBasics electronics had melted, exploded, or burst into flames.\nIt has taken some time for Amazon to address the issues around recalls and safety concerns, following these complaints, but the company has historically monitored sources like the CPSC, as well as recalls.gov, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and then taken action \u2014 like removing sellers or putting warnings on product pages.\nThe new page is live now, and Amazon says it will proactively notify customers about recalls and safety alerts going forward.\n\nPrime today, gone tomorrow: Chinese products get pulled from Amazon\n\n",

        "content": "During Spotify\u2019s second-quarter earnings call this morning, CEO Daniel Ek teased a few ways the streaming service could introduce additional AI-powered functionality. Ek touched on how AI could be used to create more personalized experiences, summarize podcasts and generate ads.\nEarlier this year, the company launched a DJ feature that delivers a curated selection of music alongside AI-powered spoken commentary about the tracks and artists you like. Ek says consumers can expect to see similar AI-powered features that aim to contextualize and personalize content across the streaming service in the future.\n\u201cDJ is a phenomenal product,\u201d Ek said during the call. \u201cIt\u2019s probably one of my personal favorites over the last few years that we have developed, and we\u2019ve seen really strong consumer interactions with that. And that just talks about the ability for us to contextualize and personalize all the amazing content that we are have on the Spotify platform. So I think you\u2019re going to see a lot more of that where we can contextualize and personalize content across the entire platform to make it more accessible.\u201d\nOne of the ways Spotify may use generative AI is by leveraging it to summarize what podcasts are about, as it can be somewhat difficult to get into new podcasts. Ek said doing so could make it easier to merchandise new podcasts for consumers, which would in turn lead to higher engagement and more growth for creators.\nEk says another way AI could be used to make Spotify more efficient is through AI-generated audio ads.\n\u201cBy using generative AI and our tools here, I think you\u2019re going to be able to see that we can significantly reduce the cost that it takes for advertisers to develop new ad formats,\u201d Ek said. \u201cAnd that obviously means that you as an advertiser instead of having one ad, you can imagine having thousands and tested across the Spotify networks, things that you could easily do today using text but you haven\u2019t been able to do over video or in audio.\u201d\nEk\u2019s comments come as Spotify is seeking a patent for an AI-powered \u201ctext-to-speech synthesis\u201d system. The patent was published on July 20 and filed back in February. The technology can take text and convert it into human-like speech audio that incorporates emotion and intention. The system can create realistic speech that is capable of conveying emotions such as anger, happiness or sadness, along with intentions such as sarcasm. It\u2019s also capable of doing so in a whispering or shouting manner, and in accents.\nThe patent indicates that Spotify is looking to go beyond its DJ feature, which simply says a few AI-powered sentences between songs. The text-to-speech synthesis system has the potential to be used for things like narrating audiobooks using AI in a way that sounds natural. It\u2019s worth noting that Apple launched AI-powered audio narration for select titles on Apple Books early this year.\nThe patent filing and Ek\u2019s comments come as Spotify has been investing in AI voice technology. Last year, the streaming service acquired\u00a0Sonantic, a London-based startup that has built an AI engine to create realistic-sounding human voices from text, for an undisclosed sum. Spotify leveraged the acquisition to power its AI DJ feature.\nSpotify\u2019s second-quarter earnings revealed that there are currently 220 million people who pay for a Spotify subscription around the world \u2014 that number is up 17% year over year. Overall, Spotify now has 551 million monthly active users. The company reported nearly \u20ac3.2 billion ($3.5 billion at today\u2019s exchange rate) in revenue for the most recent quarter. Revenue is up 11% year over year. However, Spotify also reported \u20ac247 million ($274 million) in operating loss .\nSpotify also announced a price hike for its premium plans yesterday. In the U.S., an individual premium plan will now cost $10.99 per month instead of $9.99. The duo plan will cost $14.99 instead of $12.99 and the family plan will be priced at $16.99 instead of $15.99.\n\nSpotify reports strong user growth as it is raising subscription price\n\n",

According to NASA, a technology is a \u201ctipping point\u201d if an investment in a demonstration would significantly mature the technology and bring it to market, for both future NASA missions and commercial customers.\nIn a statement, Prasun Desai, acting associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said that the awards are meant \u201cto push crucial technologies over the finish line.\u201d\n\u201cOur partnerships with industry could be a cornerstone of humanity\u2019s return to the Moon under Artemis,\u201d he said.\nFive of the 11 awards are for technologies to support long-term exploration of the moon.

Operational mistakes while scaling might have an exorbitant price.\nWe faced it when we decided to break into edtech and launch an education app that aims to provide experts the ability to answer millions of students\u2019 requests in an online chat, almost instantly.\nWe started with a team of 20 people, which was enough to cover the demand in the early stages. To make the business profitable, the real race started: The marketing team had to scale the number of users, while operations had to follow their pace and grow the supply side.\nWe scaled demand without considering team resources.\nWe got up to speed quickly: 120+ experts were solving 3,000+ math tasks daily. We staked on the high pace to survive on the market, so the operations team was scaling the supply side by leaps and bounds.\n\n\n\t\t\tWe concentrated on scaling and didn\u2019t have time to think if the resources of our team were enough to keep going with such speed.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nOur marketing scaled rapidly, which was a good thing. Following the need to cover the increased demand from the users\u2019 side in time, my team scaled the supply side 3x in one and a half months and 2x again two months later. Finally, we got 300+ math experts who were able to solve 10,000+ tasks daily. I was proud, thrilled, and freaking out at the same time.\nI realized that in the last five months, our supply had worked on demand covering, time of service delivery, and quality of solutions. We concentrated on scaling and didn\u2019t have time to think if the resources of our team were enough to keep going with such speed.\nAs a leader, I had to stop and look at the bigger picture.\nThe five-step plan I crafted to prevent the approaching \u201ccatastrophe\u201d\n1.

The work pace might be high, and people must implement tasks and solve issues immediately rather than describe the current process.\nI described all the processes for that moment just as they were. It helped me understand the real point where we were at that moment. I figured out which things went out of control and might result in a big issue soon.\nAfterward, all the processes were updated according to the following framework:\nImage Credits: Julia Ivzhenko\n2. Identified all the bottlenecks\nI noted two types of bottlenecks:\nFirst: Subprocesses, which were spontaneously added to key processes while scaling.\nI discovered that due to the number of updates, my team members had to do too many additional actions, which were not noted before. Thus, I reviewed everything we did and simplified the general process. We focused only on \u201cmust-do\u201d things, which influenced the result the most and put other \u201cnice-to-do\u201d tasks on hold.\nImage Credits: Julia Ivzhenko\nSecond: Managers, who didn\u2019t delegate tasks in time and stuck with an enormous number of tasks.\nUnfortunately, I was one of them. I was doing too many things at the same time, and they never came to an end. In my case, it happened primarily because of hiring mistakes, which appeared to be the most expensive ones.",

        "content": "OpenAI has shut down its AI classifier, a tool that claimed to determine the likelihood a text passage was written by another AI. While many used and perhaps unwisely relied on it to catch low-effort cheats, OpenAI has retired it over its widely criticized \u201clow rate of accuracy.\u201d\nThe theory that AI-generated text has some identifying feature or pattern that can be detected reliably seems intuitive, but so far this has not really been borne out in practice. Although some generated text may have an obvious tell, the differences between large language models and the rapidity with which they have developed has made those tells all but impossible to rely on.\nTechCrunch\u2019s own test of a gaggle of AI-writing-detection tools concluded that they are at best hit or miss and at worst totally worthless. Of seven generated text snippets given to a variety of detectors, GPTZero identified five correctly and OpenAI\u2019s classifier only one. And that was with a language model that was not cutting-edge even at the time.\nBut some took the claims of detection at face value, or rather well above it, since OpenAI shipped the classifier tool with a list of limitations significant enough that one wondered why they put the thing out at all. People who were worried that their students, job applicants, or freelancers were submitting generated text would put it into the classifier to test it, and while the results should not have been trusted, they sometimes were.\nGiven that language models have only improved and proliferated, it seems someone at the company decided it was time they took this fickle tool offline. \u201cWe are working to incorporate feedback and are currently researching more effective provenance techniques for text,\u201d reads a July 20 addendum to the classifier announcement post. (Decrypt seems to have been the first to notice the change.)\n\nMost sites claiming to catch AI-written text fail spectacularly\n\nI asked about the timing and reasoning behind shuttering the classifier and will update if I hear back. But it\u2019s curious that it should happen around the time OpenAI joined several other companies in a White House\u2013led \u201cvoluntary commitment\u201d to develop AI ethically and transparently.\nAmong the commitments made by the companies is that of developing robust watermarking and/or detection methods. Or attempting to do so, anyway: Despite every company making noise to this effect over the last six months or so, we have yet to see any watermark or detection method that is not trivially circumvented.\nNo doubt the first to accomplish this feat will be richly rewarded (any such tool, if truly reliable, would be invaluable in countless circumstances), so it is probably superfluous to make it a part of any AI accords.\n",

        "content": "At the height of the COVID-19 health crisis, when many of us \u2014 forced by quarantine rules and social distancing guidelines \u2014 were locked indoors and away from public spaces, Clubhouse, the audio-focused social platform, grew explosively. A platform where anyone could talk about . . . well, just about anything, Clubhouse drew millions of users seeking a reprieve from pandemic-induced isolation.\nLooking to replicate Clubhouse\u2019s success, tech giants began developing their own audio-focused, radio-like products \u2014 see Twitter Spaces, Spotify Live, LinkedIn\u2019s Audio Events and Meta\u2019s Clubhouse competitor. Not one to be left in the dust, Amazon, too, got in the race with Amp, a platform that lets people create live \u201cradio shows\u201d where they can act as DJs by taking callers and playing songs from Amazon\u2019s licensed catalog fee-free.\nBut while Amazon had grand ambitions for Amp, the app struggled to get off the ground, documents shared with TechCrunch show.\nPoint of differentiation\nAmp, once known internally as Project Mic, was a belated entry for Amazon into the live audio market. By the time Amp launched in March 2022, Clubhouse had established its dominance, raising funds at a reported valuation of around $4 billion.\nAmazon sought to make up for lost ground by strongly differentiating its product from rivals, providing access out the gate to a vast music catalog. Amp users, once signed in with an Amazon account, can play DJ, streaming and chatting about their favorite songs and artists to establish themselves as tastemakers. Or they can use the app to talk about anything else, like sports or pop culture, but do so while also curating a selection of music for their listeners.\nAs part of the launch in March 2022, Amazon announced a slate of Amp-exclusive shows and programs, including from artists, radio hosts, sportscasters, culture writers and personalities like Nicki Minaj (\u201cQueen Radio\u201d), Tefi Pessoa and Guy Raz, among others.\nAmp launched on iOS, Amazon Alexa devices and the web in beta, only in the U.S. to start. Amazon was targeted at over 1 million monthly active users by the end of 2022, according to internal documents \u2014 a tenth of Clubhouse\u2019s user base at its peak.\nBut Amp never came close to achieving that milestone.\nAmp, which had roughly 32,000 monthly active users as of the end of March 2022, was sitting just short of 200,000 monthly active users by late October. (A source tells TechCrunch that the number is hovering around 700,000 today.) The metric was previously reported by Business Insider, but TechCrunch was able to independently confirm it.\nFrom September 2022 to October 2022, monthly first-time iOS app installs declined precipitously from ~76,000 to ~43,000, internal documents show. And Amp encountered roadblocks on the engagement front, despite its lineup of high-profile content. Between September 2022 and October 2022, the number of hours users spent listening to Amp shows dipped 51% from a peak of around 183,000.\nEven without access to internal data, it\u2019s obvious that Amp isn\u2019t the most active of the live audio platforms cohort.\nAmp\u2019s flagship programming, like the Zach Sang Show and Nick Cannon\u2019s recently launched morning show, attract only a few dozen to hundreds of listeners per episode after hours on air. The official Amp blog hasn\u2019t been updated since last December. And Amp, which hasn\u2019t officially exited beta, has yet to come to Android despite the website\u2019s promises of an Android client \u201csoon.\u201d\nAmp\u2019s failure to gain traction reflects both the declining appetite for \u201csocial audio\u201d and the tough competition in the market. Analysts blame poor scalability and the lack of monetization options; one of Clubhouse\u2019s most-listened-to streams, an exclusive interview with Adele by Oprah Winfrey, managed to attract only about 40,000 concurrent listeners.\nBy April 2021, Clubhouse \u2014 once a titan in the space it created \u2014 had suffered a drop in monthly downloads from 10 million to 900,000 in February 2021, according to Sensor Tower numbers. Last June, Meta ended Live Audio Rooms after initially saying it would incorporate aspects of the experience into Facebook Live. And late last year, Spotify shut down Spotify Live after investing tens of millions in acquiring a startup, Betty Labs, to build the service.\nBut Amazon isn\u2019t blameless.\nAmp\u2019s expansion beyond the U.S. has proceeded at a snail\u2019s pace, perhaps due to the music licensing requirements to bring the platform to other countries. And Amazon has made few attempts to market Amp across its other platforms, particularly its storefront and Alexa devices. Internal data shows that Alexa users made up ~44,000 of the roughly ~100,000 active Amp listeners as of October 2022, a tiny fraction of Alexa\u2019s 500-million-plus-device-strong install base.\nIn the absence of growth, some of Amp\u2019s headlining creators have left the platform. Halsey, Travis Barker and Big Boi, who Amazon touted as launch partners, haven\u2019t hosted a show on Amp for several months.\nIn what might have been an effort to stem the bleeding, Amazon late last year launched a fund to reward creators on Amp for \u201ccreating engaging shows and building loyal audiences.\u201d But the rollout was light on the details, including how much money Amazon planned to devote to the program, exactly, and came around the same time the company laid off roughly half of Amp\u2019s staff.\nIt\u2019s not clear where Amp might go from here, given the state of the service as it exists today. But one thing\u2019s for sure: If the ultimate goal was to drive Amazon account sign-ups, Amp fell well short. Documents show that Amp was driving at most single-digit thousands of users to create Amazon accounts each month.\nWhen reached for comment, Amazon characterized all the metrics in this article as \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\n\u201cAmp launched in March 2022 in beta, and we\u2019ve seen rapid growth as the service has continued to evolve,\u201d a spokesperson said via email. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to optimize for our customers and are very excited for the product roadmap ahead.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Google is introducing a few new ways to make it easier for users to find relevant information when searching for women\u2019s sports, the company announced on Tuesday. The new updates come in time for the 2023 FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup.\nThe search giant says it has expanded coverage of women\u2019s competitions in the information boxes you see at the top of the results page to include over 380 leagues. Plus, Google has added more than 110 leagues across women\u2019s soccer, cricket and rugby over the past year. It has also partnered with broadcasters and rights holders to provide easy access to live streams and highlights directly from the Search results page.\nGoogle wrote in a blog post:\nMost of the time, our automated systems are able to tell what you\u2019re looking for by the words and context of your query. But there are other times, with these more ambiguous queries, when our systems are unable to tell which team \u2014 the men\u2019s or women\u2019s \u2014 or which specific person you\u2019re looking for. We have and are continuing to roll out updates to make the features we surface for gender ambiguous queries more inclusive, for example making it easier to switch back and forth between men\u2019s and women\u2019s results for sports tournaments.\nGoogle says its systems are taking into account increasing searches around tournaments and other factors so that they can better understand what users are actually looking for. By doing so, Google will be able to surface features related to women\u2019s leagues and trending events.\nImage Credits: Google\nIn addition, Google has made improvements for searches in gendered languages like Spanish, German and Hindi. For example, queries like \u201cjugadoras de b\u00e9isbol\u201d (the feminine of \u201cbaseball players\u201d in Spanish) now give more gender-correct responses.\nGoogle notes that although its systems are getting better at surfacing women\u2019s sports coverage, it recognizes that there are imbalances across the web in terms of how men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports are covered. For example, if there\u2019s a prevalence of content about men\u2019s sports, that might mean Search is more likely to surface such information. To address this, Google is working with content creators and news publishers to increase the amount of relevant and high-quality media coverage of women\u2019s sports.\nFor this year\u2019s FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup, users will be able to watch official highlights, follow their favorite teams, get notifications throughout the games and browse stats like head-to-head records, recent form and win probability.\n",

        "content": "Bad news could be brewing for Apple in France, where the national competition authority has issued a statement of objections related to how it tracks iOS users.\nThe watchdog, L\u2019Autorit\u00e9 de la Concurrence, said today that it suspects the iPhone maker of abusing a dominant position by implementing what it described as \u201cdiscriminatory, non-objective and non-transparent\u201d conditions for the use of user data for advertising purposes.\nIt has been investigating how Apple uses iOS user data for ad targeting for several years \u2014 following complaints by several advertising industry groups, which, back in 2021, sought to have the watchdog block Apple\u2019s introduction of the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) feature.\nATT requires third-party apps to ask iOS users for permission to track them for ad targeting. And advertisers quickly accused Apple of not playing fair since, unlike third-party apps, its own native iOS apps did not trigger the same up-front ask to users over whether Apple could use their data for so-called personalized ads. Instead, iOS users had to proactively search in settings to opt out of Apple\u2019s own tracking.\nIn March 2021, the French watchdog declined to block the introduction of ATT but said it would continue to investigate whether Apple is applying less restrictive rules for its own apps versus third-party developers (aka \u201cself-preferencing\u201d).\nToday it\u2019s warned Apple that it believes it is abusing a dominant position by doing that.\nApple was contacted for comment on the French watchdog\u2019s statement of objections. A company spokesperson sent this statement:\nApp Tracking Transparency (ATT) gives users more control by requiring all apps to ask permission before tracking them. Apple, like all developers, is required to comply with ATT. Apple\u2019s apps do not show an ATT prompt because they do not track, meaning they do not link user or device data with user or device data collected from other companies\u2019 apps, websites, or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes, nor do they share user or device data with data brokers. Additionally, Apple holds its advertising business to a higher standard of privacy than it requires of any other developer by prompting users for explicit permission before delivering any personalized ads. We have previously received strong support from regulators and privacy advocates on the goal of ATT, including from the FCA [French Competition Authority] and the CNIL [French data protection authority], and we will continue to engage with the FCA constructively to ensure users remain in control of their data.\nIt has previously defended how it implements app tracking \u2014 arguing it applies its pro-privacy rules equally to all developers, including itself, while simultaneously claiming it holds itself to a higher privacy standard than \u201calmost any other company\u201d by providing users with a choice over ad tracking.\nApple also argues that its own apps do not need to show an ATT prompt because they do not track users, in the sense it defines the term \u2014 which means they do not link user or device data with user or device data collected from other companies\u2019 apps, websites, or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes; nor do they share user or device data with data brokers \u2014 hence its claim to hold itself to a \u201chigher standard of privacy\u201d than most other businesses.\nPer Apple, its pro-privacy measures are also extremely popular with its users \u2014 with a large majority of iOS users choosing not to be served personalized ads. As of Q1 2022, it said 78% of App Store search volume for devices running iOS 15 or later came from devices with personalized ads turned off.\nCupertino now has a chance to respond to the French watchdog\u2019s accusations before a final decision can be reached by the regulator.\nIf it confirms an antitrust breach, it has powers to fine Apple and/or order it to rectify infringing behavior. However, at this stage the watchdog only suspects an abuse. And in a brief press release announcing the statement of objections, L\u2019Autorit\u00e9\u00a0emphasized this step does not prejudice the outcome of its investigation.\n\nFrance\u2019s competition authority declines to block Apple\u2019s opt-in consent for iOS app tracking\n\n",

        "content": "Popular flight tracking app Flighty, a 2023 Apple Design Award winner, is launching a new version that turns its handy flight information resource into something more akin to a private social network for close friends and family who want to track each others\u2019 travels. With today\u2019s launch of Flighty 3.0, users will have a new way of sharing their flight information with trusted others, without having to rely on forwarding airline confirmation emails or sending texts.\nInstead, Flighty is introducing the concept of \u201cFlighty Friends,\u201d a way to track loved ones\u2019 flight details automatically. The concept builds on the friends\u2019 flights feature already available in previous versions of Flighty, which allowed users to share their live flight information with others through the app.\nNow, users can connect directly with one another in Flighty \u2014 similar to how you would \u201cfriend\u201d someone on a social network. Afterward, the connected users would receive updates about their family members\u2019 or friends\u2019 flights on an ongoing basis. The app\u2019s notifications would then read something like \u201cmom has landed,\u201d instead of just noting a flight number has landed, and would include the user\u2019s profile photo.\nImage Credits: Flighty\nIn addition, a new \u201cToday\u201d screen will show the flight locations of everyone you\u2019ve added, if their flights are taking off within 24 hours.\nFlighty assures users their flight info is only visible to those they\u2019ve shared with, but this won\u2019t include sensitive details, like a booking code. Plus, users can share their flight info with friends who don\u2019t have the app. Users can also disable sharing at any time.\nThe feature, which is not a paid upgrade, makes the most sense for spouses or significant others, parents and children, and other close family members and friends as it provides real-time access to someone\u2019s location, not all that different from Apple\u2019s \u201cFind My\u201d or a location tracker, like Life360.\nBut while location tracking apps are tied to someone\u2019s current GPS location, Flighty extends that tracking to the air, offering all the usual flight tracking information someone would need \u2014 like flight plans, weather conditions, delays, FAA advisories and warnings, late or canceled aircraft, connection information and more.\nThe app also makes clever use of Apple\u2019s live Lock Screen widgets and Live Activities in the Dynamic Island (the notch) on the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max for Flighty subscribers. Paying customers can also take advantage of other features like calendar and TripIt sync, email forwarding and more detailed information, among other things.\nAccording to Flighty developer Ryan Jones, the app is the first to introduce this concept of a \u201cflying private network,\u201d a first of its kind. But he hesitates to call it a social network, noting it\u2019s not about racking up follower counts or publicizing your information.\nImage Credits: Flighty\n\u201cNo other service has ever successfully built \u2018friends for flying,'\u201d he says. \u201cThey all try to make it social and public. But that\u2019s not what users want. They want to share with just a few friends and family, all privately, without signing up for a new service. We think people are going to love it,\u201d Jones adds.\nThe app to date has been downloaded millions of times but doesn\u2019t disclose its user numbers or subscribers. However, Jones notes Flighty is a cash-flow positive and self-sustaining company.\n",

        "title": "Whither Israel? Israeli tech players comment on the impact of the country\u2019s convulsions",
        "content": "As we covered in April, Israel has become convulsed by \u201creforms\u201d to the judiciary, proposed by the Benjamin Netanyahu-led government, which passed yesterday. There is now deep concern that the judiciary\u2019s 75-year history as an institution independent and separate from the government could be limited by the ruling political party of the day. Critics of Netanyahu say the changes remove important checks on the executive\u2019s authority and could be open to abuse. Proponents say the reforms will cool the judiciary\u2019s alleged \u201coverreach.\u201d\nYesterday, Israel\u2019s parliament ratified the first bill, after compromise efforts collapsed and opposition parties walked out in protest.\nPublic demonstrations against the amendment have been going on for weeks, and reached a crescendo yesterday, with protesters being dragged away from the parliament by police. Thousands took to the streets across the country, blocking highways. The opposition and other groups now plan to appeal against the law at the Supreme Court.\nWhat will be the effect on Israel\u2019s \u201cStartup Nation\u201d reputation? Is one of the world\u2019s most innovative tech ecosystems now under threat from political strife?\nIt\u2019s almost certainly too early to tell what the long-term effects will be, but there are signs that hi-tech players are moving fast to reduce the impact on their businesses.\nJust ahead of this week\u2019s parliamentary vote, tech industry nonprofit Start-Up Nation Central conducted a survey of participants in the Israeli venture and hi-tech market.\nIt found that 22% of companies were already diversifying their cash reserves outside of Israel, and 37% of investors said their portfolio companies have withdrawn some of their reserves and moved them overseas. Some 8% of companies reported that they had already begun the process of relocating their headquarters, and 29% indicated their intention to do so in the near future.\nEven more startling, almost 70% of Israeli investors said their portfolio companies intended to relocate their headquarters in the future and register in another country.\nThe uncertainty caused by the judicial \u201creforms\u201d are also leading to staff layoffs, with almost half saying they have already laid off between 10% and 30% of their employees, and just over 20% of companies are planning to relocate their employees away from Israel.\nWe asked entrepreneurs, investors and ecosystem players in Israel to comment on the situation. Here are their thoughts:\nEynat Guez, CEO, co-founder Papaya Global\nThe tech industry is coming back to the days of the early 2000\u2019s where Israeli tech founders needed to relocate to the US in order to raise funds, needed to incorporate in the US and eventually building companies outside of Israel with some R&D resources in Israel.\nThis is already happening. Tech engineers are leaving \u2014 some to \u201ctemporary\u201d places like Greece and Cyprus. Some for good, to Europe, to the UK, Portugal, Spain, and US. The recent events are the too much for them to carry \u2014 the cost of living, heavy taxation and a government that invests a minimum amount in basic infrastructure, such as transportation and education.\nThe other issue is that we will see more mature companies shutting down, if they are not performing extremely well and they are incorporated in Israel. The risk factor for investors is just too high, they\u2019ll miss the opportunity to raise additional funds.\nRoi Carthy, CMO at LIQUiDITY Group\nThe so called \u201creforms\u201d are already having a devastating impact on the Israeli startup industry. Most new startups are registering as American companies along with the IP. Investments have slowed as well. Most importantly though, the local talent \u2014 the most important ingredient of \u201cStartup Nation\u201d \u2014 is seeing increasing numbers looking to move elsewhere in the short, medium and long term. Many of us can\u2019t see ourselves raising our children here under a non-democratic regime, and messianic economic policies.\nHillel Fuld, startup marketing advisor\nYou need to differentiate between short term and long term effects. Short term it will most definitely affect Israeli tech. It already has. The Shekel is down, Israeli investors are tightening their operations, and global investors are more reluctant to deploy capital in Israel.\nThe thing is, in my opinion, as someone who is NOT pro the reform in its current format, this is the definition of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The protestors are yelling day and night that this reform will transform Israel into a dictatorship, which is ridiculous and baseless. They are yelling all day long how this is the end of Israel, which it is not.\nSo it\u2019s no surprise that investors are being cautious with Israel. These protesters are claiming the economy will crash, so they are crashing the economy.\nLong term, on the other hand, this will not impact Israeli tech. In one year from now, Israel will be stronger than ever. More investments, more unicorns, and more IPOs.\nA VC from a prominent fund in Israel who asked not to be named\nFirst I think (and hope) that current modifications to the Israeli law \u2013 are temporary and will be restored once a new parliament is re-elected, in 3.5 yrs time. In the meantime, we have an uncomfortable situation. I do believe that entrepreneurs will now relocate to the US with greater ease. But the main activity of R&D will still remain in Israel. This can be good news for the scalability of Israeli startups. One of the issues I\u2019ve experienced in recent years is a lack of willingness of founders to relocate to the US \u2013 which many times held back their growth.\nThere are obviously more doomsday scenarios. But these were promoted in order to put pressure on the current government and coalition. I believe it actually helped in stopping most of the modifications, but not all \u2013 as we saw yesterday. I believe that the Nasdaq index has a much bigger impact on Israeli hitech than any thing else.\nKfir Ben-Shooshan, chairman & founder, Inokim Scooters\nWhile the ongoing reform of the legal system is imperative to establish a robust and independent court that upholds the laws passed by the Knesset, it is equally essential to strike a balance that respects the diverse perspectives and values within our society. We must ensure that this reform process takes into account the concerns and interests of all stakeholders, including the tech industry, which holds immense significance in Israel\u2019s economy and innovation landscape.\nAs the government forges ahead with its reforms, it is natural for some apprehensions to arise about their potential impact on the tech sector. It is incumbent upon us to carefully evaluate these changes and consider their implications for the tech companies operating in Israel\u2026 I also want to acknowledge that Benjamin Netanyahu, commonly referred to as Bibi, has demonstrated mastery in handling the economy during his time as Prime Minister. His policies and leadership have been instrumental in driving Israel\u2019s economic growth and stability. Therefore, I have confidence that under his guidance, the necessary measures will be taken to support the tech industry and foster an environment that encourages companies to remain in Israel.\nThough I refrain from speculating on whether tech companies will leave or stay, my belief in the strength of Israel\u2019s economy and the tech sector leads me to be optimistic about their continued presence and success within our nation. I am not worried about companies leaving; rather, I believe the opposite is true \u2014 that the tech industry will remain robust and continue to thrive.\nHaggai Scolnicov, Co-Founder CEO, Optimeet AI\n\u201cThe coup attempt (\u201creform\u201d is misleading \u2018Newspeak\u2018) is a huge threat to Israel\u2019s tech ecosystem. Honestly, many people think it\u2019s the greatest threat Israel has faced in its 75 years of statehood, since the 1948 War of Independence. So decimating the tech industry almost sounds like a detail. Of course, it\u2019s more than that. Our economy, the tech sector,  democratic culture, liberal society, education, law and order, they\u2019re all intertwined. When it all works together, our incredible tech workers and founders want to live and work here, and we can create amazing things. If you start deliberately unraveling that, it all comes tumbling down.\nIt\u2019s not that the coup will have an effect on the tech industry. It has had and is having a terrible impact. Some of it is still beneath the surface, so you don\u2019t see it yet, but at some point it could just boil over. Because so many of us in the tech industry are on the literal front  lines of this struggle, every day, we haven\u2019t given up hope and really haven\u2019t had time or inclination to make \u201cbackup plans\u201d. Yes, we\u2019ve seen: relocations abroad, Israelis founding startups  as US companies, investors shying away from Israel because of \u201ccountry risk\u201d and dangerous legislation. Yes, there is a very real and very frightening combined risk from the economy, security situation, and general mismanagement and corruption: if we don\u2019t stop the current government\u2019s plans, those will spiral into a combined disaster.\nBut, we\u2019re here and we\u2019re fighting to keep Israel the best place to live and work and raise our children in. So a lot of the tech sector looks like it\u2019s \u201cstill there\u201d, concealing the real damage. And we can build back, if we get the opportunity soon. But if and when the amazing people who make Israel into the \u201cStartup Nation\u201d decide the recent dreadful changes are irreversible, then Netanyahu can add the tech industry to the list of Israeli institutions ruined. We\u2019re fighting to stop that from happening.\u201d\n",

        "content": "\nIt\u2019s been almost two weeks since a federal court ruling settled a years-long battle between Ripple Labs and the SEC over the nature of Ripple\u2019s XRP token. Southern District of New York judge Analisa Torres ruled that the XRP token is not a security when sold to the general public, but it can be treated as a security for past XRP sales to institutional clients.\nThe verdict was a \u201cwin\u201d for both the company and the crypto community alike, but Stu Alderoty, chief legal officer of Ripple Labs, hinted on TechCrunch\u2019s Chain Reaction podcast that the search for regulatory clarity is far from over.\n\nThe SEC said after the ruling that the verdict in favor of Ripple on secondary markets sales was \u201cwrongly decided\u201d and the court \u201cshould not follow them.\u201d The statement was mentioned in legal documents for a separate case against Terraform Labs, and the agency said it\u2019s considering other available avenues for further review.\nBut Ripple won\u2019t shy away from the SEC\u2019s likely appeal, Alderoty said. \u201cWe think the judge got that right, and we think that was a faithful application of the law, and I think a court of appeals will not only affirm that but maybe even amplify that to even a greater extent.\u201d",

        "content": "San Francisco startup Ample is bringing its modular electric vehicle battery swapping technology to Mitsubishi Fuso\u2019s electric trucks this winter, the company said Tuesday. This marks the first time Ample\u2019s technology is being used for large vehicles. The company\u2019s technology is currently being used on a small scale for ride-hail vehicles in San Francisco and Madrid.\nThe partnership with Mitsubishi builds on Ample\u2019s work with Japanese energy company Eneos to deploy swapping infrastructure for fleets to use. Ample wouldn\u2019t say how many swapping stations would be coming to Japan this winter, but it will be \u201cmore than one station\u201d for the initial deployment in Kyoto.\nAmple\u2019s tech will be going into Mitsubishi\u2019s Fuso eCanter, a light commercial truck. It\u2019s not clear how many trucks will have Ample\u2019s vehicle-agnostic batteries, nor which fleet partners have signed on. An Ample spokesperson told TechCrunch the initial fleets will be used for last-mile delivery.\nThe startup says its next-generation swapping stations have improved from earlier models and can change out a battery in five minutes. With DC fast charging, it could take a car anywhere from 15 minutes to nearly an hour to get a full charge.\nAmple\u2019s moves in Japan come after the company recently launched two stations in Madrid, and says it\u2019s in the process of deploying more. The company is working with Moove, a Madrid-based mobility fleet that provides ridesharing vehicles on the Uber platform. Ample recently received a \u20ac10 million grant from the Spanish government to assist with expanding the deployment.\nEV battery swapping hasn\u2019t gotten much of a foothold in the U.S., where most of the innovation is directed at charging stations. But in other parts of the world, like China, battery swapping is becoming more popular. Beijing is supporting a few companies that are advancing the technology as part of its broader plan to ensure 25% of all cars sold by 2025 are electric.\nChinese EV maker Nio, for example, has already been building out stations and in March started trialing a more efficient type of station that can store up to 21 battery packs and swap in less than five minutes. Nio has a target of reaching 2,300 battery swapping stations globally by the end of 2023.\n\nAmple\u2019s co-founder explains what it takes to scale EV battery swapping\n\n\nAmple\u2019s John de Souza on the merits of B2B, company culture and investors who get it\n\n",

        "title": "ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot",
        "content": "ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. It\u2019s able to write essays, code and more given short text prompts, hyper-charging productivity. But it also has a more\u2026nefarious side.\nIn any case, AI tools are not going away \u2014 and indeed has expanded dramatically since its launch just a few months ago. Major brands are experimenting with it, using the AI to generate ad and marketing copy, for example.\u00a0\nAnd OpenAI is heavily investing in it. ChatGPT was recently super-charged by GPT-4, the latest language-writing model from OpenAI\u2019s labs. Paying ChatGPT users have access to GPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than the model that previously powered ChatGPT. In addition to GPT-4, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet with plugins available in alpha to users and developers on the waitlist.\nHere\u2019s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, to be updated regularly. We also answer the most common FAQs (see below).\nTimeline of the most recent ChatGPT updates\nJuly 25, 2023\nChatGPT for Android is now available in the US, India, Bangladesh and Brazil\nA few days after putting up\u00a0a preorder page\u00a0on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and\u00a0released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.\nJuly 21, 2023\nChatGPT is coming to Android\nChatGPT is available to \u201cpre-order\u201d for Android users.\nThe ChatGPT app on Android\u00a0looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version\u2019s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too \u2014 so if you\u2019re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.\nJuly 20, 2023\nOpenAI launches customized instructions for ChatGPT\nOpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don\u2019t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.\nThe company said this feature lets you \u201cshare anything you\u2019d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.\u201d For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.\nJuly 13, 2023\nThe FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAI\u00a0\nThe FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI\u2019s flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made \u201cfalse, misleading, disparaging or harmful\u201d statements about people.\nTechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:\nThis kind of investigation doesn\u2019t just appear out of thin air \u2014 the FTC doesn\u2019t look around and say \u201cThat looks suspicious.\u201d Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there\u2019s evidence the company lied about the side effects.\nJuly 6, 2023\nOpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4\nStarting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers \u201cwith a history of successful payments\u201d can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.\nIn the future, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and\u00a0GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI\u2019s other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.\nJune 28, 2023\nChatGPT app can now search the web only on Bing\nOpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.\nThe Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting \u201cGPT-4\u201d in the model switcher and choosing \u201cBrowse with Bing\u201d from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.\nJune 15, 2023\nMercedes is adding ChatGPT to its infotainment system\nU.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car\u2019s conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car \u201cHey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not really clear what for, though.\nJune 8, 2023\nChatGPT app is now available on iPad, adds support for Siri and Shortcuts\nThe new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chat bot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.\nOn iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet\u2019s interface.\nMay 30, 2023\nTexas judge orders all AI-generated content must be declared and checked\nThe Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that \u201cno portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,\u201d or if it was, that it was checked \u201cby a human being.\u201d\nMay 26, 2023\nChatGPT app expanded to more than 30 countries\nThe list of new countries include Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Ghana, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.\nMay 25, 2023\nChatGPT app is now available in 11 more countries\nOpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store. In just six days, the app topped 500,000 downloads.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for iOS is now available to users in 11 more countries \u2014 Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the UK. More to come soon!\n\u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 24, 2023\n\nMay 18, 2023\nOpenAI launches a ChatGPT app for iOS\nChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.\nWhen using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices \u2014 meaning it will know what you\u2019ve previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with\u00a0Whisper, OpenAI\u2019s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.\nMay 3, 2023\nHackers are using ChatGPT lures to spread malware on Facebook\nMeta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users\u2019 devices.\n\u201cIn one case, we\u2019ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,\u201d said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in\u00a0a blog post. \u201cThey would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.\u201d\nApril 28, 2023\nChatGPT parent company OpenAI closes $300M share sale at $27B-29B valuation\nVC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft\u2019s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.\nApril 25, 2023\nOpenAI previews new subscription tier, ChatGPT Business\nCalled ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as \u201cfor professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.\u201d\n\u201cChatGPT Business will follow our API\u2019s data usage policies, which means that end users\u2019 data won\u2019t be used to train our models by default,\u201d OpenAI\u00a0wrote in a blog post. \u201cWe plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.\u201d\nApril 24, 2023\nOpenAI wants to trademark \u201cGPT\u201d\nOpenAI applied\u00a0for a trademark for \u201cGPT,\u201d which stands for \u201cGenerative Pre-trained Transformer,\u201d last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the \u201cmyriad infringements and counterfeit apps\u201d beginning to spring into existence.\nUnfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was\u00a0dismissed\u00a0last week. According to the agency, OpenAI\u2019s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide \u201cappropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.\u201d\nThat means a decision could take up to five more months.\nApril 22, 2023\nAuto-GPT is Silicon Valley\u2019s latest quest to automate everything\u00a0\nAuto-GPT is an open source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI\u2019s latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to \u201cautonomously\u201d perform tasks.\nDepending on what objective the tool\u2019s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very\u2026 unexpected ways. One Reddit\u00a0user\u00a0claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running \u2014 and then \u201ckilled\u201d itself.\nApril 18, 2023\nFTC warns that AI technology like ChatGPT could \u2018turbocharge\u2019 fraud\u00a0\nFTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud in a congressional hearing.\n\u201cAI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,\u201d Khan told the House representatives. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We\u2019ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,\u201d she stated.\nApril 17, 2023\nSuperchat\u2019s new AI chatbot lets you message historical and fictional characters via ChatGPT\nThe company behind the popular iPhone customization app\u00a0Brass, sticker maker\u00a0StickerHub\u00a0and\u00a0others\u00a0is out today with a new AI chat app called\u00a0SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat\u2019s AI features.\nApril 12, 2023\nItaly gives OpenAI to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension order\nItaly\u2019s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the\u00a0end of last month \u2014 when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU\u2019s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals\u2019 data.\nThe DPA has given OpenAI a deadline \u2014 of April 30 \u2014 to get the regulator\u2019s compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)\nApril 12, 2023\nResearchers discover a way to make ChatGPT consistently toxic\nA study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a \u201cpersona\u201d \u2014 for example, \u201ca bad person,\u201d \u201ca horrible person\u201d or \u201ca nasty person\u201d \u2014 through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity \u2014 with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.\nThe research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.\nApril 4, 2023\nY Combinator-backed startups are trying to build \u2018ChatGPT for X\u2019\nYC Demo Day\u2019s Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building \u201cChatGPT for X.\u201d They\u2019re all chasing after a customer service software market that\u2019ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.\nHere are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:\n\nYuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.\nBaselit, which uses one of OpenAI\u2019s text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.\nLasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they\u2019d like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.\nBerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.\n\nApril 1, 2023\nItaly orders ChatGPT to be blocked\nOpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.\nItaly\u2019s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do\u00a0have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has\u00a0ordered OpenAI to stop processing people\u2019s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it\u2019s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.\nMarch 29, 2023\n1,100+ signatories signed an open letter asking all \u2018AI labs to immediately pause for 6 months\u2019\nThe letter\u2019s signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on \u201call AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.\u201d\nThe letter reads:\nContemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.\nMarch 23, 2023\nOpenAI connects ChatGPT to the internet\nOpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bots functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and\u00a0API\u00a0access.\nMarch 14, 2023\nOpenAI launches GPT-4, available through ChatGPT Plus\nGPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI. Released March 14, GPT-4 is available for paying ChatGPT Plus users and through a public API. Developers can sign up on a waitlist to access the API.\nMarch 9, 2023\nChatGPT is available in Azure OpenAI service\nChatGPT is generally available through the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft\u2019s fully managed, corporate-focused offering. Customers, who must already be \u201cMicrosoft managed customers and partners,\u201d can apply here for special access.\nMarch 1, 2023\nOpenAI launches an API for ChatGPT\nOpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat\u2019s parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.\nFebruary 7, 2023\nMicrosoft launches the new Bing, with ChatGPT built in\nAt a press event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft announced its long-rumored integration of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model into Bing, providing a ChatGPT-like experience within the search engine. The announcement spurred a 10x increase in new downloads for Bing globally, indicating a sizable consumer demand for new AI experiences.\nOther companies beyond Microsoft joined in on the AI craze by implementing ChatGPT, including OkCupid, Kaito, Snapchat and Discord \u2014 putting the pressure on Big Tech\u2019s AI initiatives, like Google.\nFebruary 1, 2023\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Plus, starting at $20 per month\nAfter ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month.\nDecember 8, 2022\nShareGPT lets you easily share your ChatGPT conversations\nA week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers \u2014 Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston \u2014 made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI\u2019s answers with the world.\nNovember 30, 2022\nChatGPT first launched to the public as OpenAI quietly released GPT-3.5\nGPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that\u2019s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts.\nWriters everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.\nFAQs:\nWhat is ChatGPT?

A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.\u00a0 And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between ChatGPT and Bard?\nMuch like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.\nChatGPT\u2019s generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been \u201clearning\u201d for a longer period of time than Bard.\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\nYes.\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\nYes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Bard and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to run today.\nThe Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from\u00a0AlphaGo, DeepMind\u2019s AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.\nApple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as \u201cApple GPT,\u201d but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\nOpenAI has\u00a0said\u00a0that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out\u00a0this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here\u00a0for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\nWho owns the copyright on ChatGPT-created content or media?\nThe user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\n",

        "content": "GM\u2019s best-selling EV is sticking around after all.\nGM Chair and CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday during the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call that the company will produce a next-generation Chevrolet Bolt EV outfitted with its new Ultium architecture that includes a new battery cell design. The decision comes just three months after Barra had announced GM would stop producing its two top-selling EVs: the Chevy Bolt and its larger sibling, the Bolt EUV, by the end of 2023. The plan was to retool its Orion Michigan factory, which currently assembles the Bolt, for electric truck production.\n\u201cOur customers love today\u2019s Bolt. It has been delivering record sales and some of the highest customer satisfaction and loyalty scores in the industry,\u201d Barra said during the call with analysts. \u201cIt\u2019s also an important source of conquest sales for the company and for Chevrolet.\u201d\nDetails on this next-generation Bolt were scarce. Barra didn\u2019t say when the next-generation Bolt EV would go into production. The automaker only generically referred to the Bolt and didn\u2019t elaborate on whether the slightly larger Bolt EUV would be included in the reboot plans.\nBarra did say this Bolt EV\u2019s turnaround would happen on an accelerated timeline and \u201cwith significantly lower engineering expense and capital investment by updating the vehicle with Ultium and Ultifi technologies and by applying our \u2018winning with simplicity\u2019 discipline.\u201d\nGM\u2019s Ultium architecture and battery design as well as its Ultifi software platform will be the foundation for its new slate of EVs, a portfolio that will include the Chevrolet Silverado EV, Blazer EV and Equinox EV. All three of those vehicles are launching this year.\nGM also\u00a0raised its 2023 guidance on Tuesday and said it would increase cost-cutting by another $1 billion as it pursues higher profits.\n",

        "content": "A few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries, such as the U.S., India, Bangladesh and Brazil.\nIf you live in a country that isn\u2019t part of that list, you can still head over to Google Play and preorder the app as OpenAI plans to release the app in more countries very soon. There will be additional countries over the next week.\nAnd if you have an iPhone, you may already be using the official ChatGPT app, as it has been available on iOS for a while. The Android release is still an important milestone for OpenAI, as there are more Android users than iOS users around the world.\nIf you are familiar with ChatGPT on the web, you can expect to get similar results from OpenAI\u2019s chatbot. But the interface has been optimized for mobile.\nInteracting with ChatGPT works more or less like sending messages to a friend in a messaging app. You can type text at the bottom of the screen and hit send \u2014\u00a0ChatGPT answers with advice, tips and whatever you need.\nThe mobile app works with your existing OpenAI account, meaning that you can see your past conversations across all your devices if you have enabled \u201cchat history & training\u201d \u2014 you can\u2019t disable one setting without disabling the other.\nWhile you can sign up with a free account, OpenAI also offers an optional subscription to access a better large language model (GPT-4) and additional features. ChatGPT Plus will be available on Android through an in-app purchase as well. If you are already a subscriber, you should be able to access ChatGPT Plus features from Android with your existing subscription.\nUpdate, 7/26/23, 1:40 PM ET: The Android version of ChatGPT is now showing north of 500,000 installs on the Google Play store, reports data.ai.\n\nChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot\n\n",

        "content": "Meta\u2019s text-based social network Threads is rolling out one of the most requested features after its launch \u2014 a Following feed. The company has also announced the ability to see posts you\u2019ve liked in your settings, which will be available soon.\nYou\u2019re able to either hide or show the For You and Following feeds by tapping on the Threads icon at the top of the app\u2019s screen.\nIn addition, the update includes new categories to sort your Activity feed, allowing you to filter by Follows, Quotes and Reposts, and a new Follow button on your followers list to easily follow other accounts back, Instagram tells TechCrunch. Plus, users with private accounts can now approve follow requests in one go with a new \u201capprove all\u201d option. Soon, users will also gain the ability to see posts they\u2019ve liked in their settings, we\u2019re told.\nIn a post on his Instagram Channel, Mark Zuckerberg said that the company is adding translation features as well.\n\u201cThreads started rolling out an option for a chronological feed of only people you\u2019re following and added translations too. More to come!\u201d he wrote.\nUsers will need to be on the latest version of the Threads app to get these new features. However, because this is a gradual roll-out, you might not see the new feed or the other options immediately.\nThe company said that translations are automatic based on the language they are written in and the user\u2019s language settings.\nImage Credits: Threads\nOn Threads, Zuckerberg quoted a user\u2019s post about a Following feed and said \u201cAsk and you shall receive.\u201d\nThe placement of the \u201cFor You\u201d and \u201cFollowing\u201d feeds appear on the top of the app \u2014 just like Twitter, we should note. That will make it easier for those leaving Twitter to get used to Threads\u2019 app.\n\n\nUpdate your Threads app. The following tab is here.\nMight be time to eXit soon. pic.twitter.com/T2QRzZQdVU\n\u2014 Tom Franklin 3.0 (@TomFranklinV3) July 25, 2023\n\nIn response to a user complaint that the new Following tab would only load a handful of posts, Threads iOS developer Cameron Roth noted the company is looking into the bug, adding \u201cSeems we have created a lot of sudden demand for some reason\u2026\u201d\nThreads has been moving fast to update its app, in the wake of Twitter\u2019s stumbles. It recently released its\u00a0first major update since its launch, bringing\u00a0support for iOS 17, now available as a public beta, among other smaller changes. It then rolled out another\u00a0update that was meant to bring translation support and more. But that update had been temporarily paused to sort out some issues.\nStill ahead for Threads are larger improvements like an edit button, multi-account support and integration with ActivityPub, the protocol powering the popular, decentralized Twitter alternative Mastodon. As Instagram head Adam Mosseri dubbed it, Threads is still \u201ca work in progress.\u201d\nShortly after its launch, Instagram Threads became an overnight success, topping 100 million users\u00a0within days of its arrival, though usage numbers have since declined.\n\nA Wall Street Journal article on Friday warned that Instagram\u2019s new Twitter competitor had begun losing steam. Citing third-party data from Sensor Tower, the paper reported the number of daily active users on Threads dropped for the second week down to 13 million, a 70% decline from a July 7 high point. By comparison, Twitter\u2019s daily active users are around 200 million.\nBut it\u2019s too early to count Threads out just yet. According to data.ai, the app has already achieved one-fifth of the weekly active user base of Twitter.\nThe addition of the in-demand Following feed feature may help to once again boost Threads\u2019 usage numbers which had dropped following the app\u2019s blowout debut.\nThe launch of the new chronological feed comes as Elon Musk removed the bird logo from Twitter and replaced it with an \u2018X\u2019 on Monday. Musk said that the company plans to \u201cbid adieu to the Twitter brand\u201d in the near future. However, the transition is not going smoothly, as most of the official handles and many parts of the website continue to feature the \u201cTwitter\u201d branding.\nMeta once again is cleverly taking advantage of the chaos at Twitter, er X, to lure users to its Twitter clone. As X seems to be in flux, proclaiming a future that involves payments, banking and video, among other things, those who want a more classic Twitter experience may find themselves trying Threads instead.\n\nThreads in decline? Don\u2019t count out Instagram\u2019s new Twitter rival yet\n\n\n",

        "title": "Jeeves hits over $40M in annualized revenue as it expands beyond corporate credit cards",
        "content": "In September of 2021, Jeeves began offering corporate credit cards as its primary product \u2014 with a primary focus on Latin America \u2014 after participating in Y Combinator\u2019s summer 2020 batch.\nBy that 2021 launch, Jeeves was describing itself as the first \u201ccross country, cross currency\u201d expense management platform \u2014 serving businesses in North America, the United Kingdom and Europe. It had raised a total of $265 million in equity funding at a valuation of $2.1 billion.\nIn 2022, the startup seemed to have hit its stride. It entered 2023 with over $40 million in annualized run rate, up 250% year-over-year, according to CEO and founder Dileep Thazhmon. And today it is announcing that it\u2019s expanding further to now offer businesses prepaid cards and cross-border payments.\nJeeves describes itself as \u201ca financial operating system built for global companies.\u201d The fully remote, New York\u2013based company is backed by investors such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), CRV and Tencent, among others, and recently raised an additional $25 million from an undisclosed sovereign wealth fund from the Middle East.\nNotably, the 182-person startup today still has over three years of runway left, Thazhmon said.\n\u201cWe were lucky to have raised at the right time. And we\u2019ve also focused on just reducing burn \u2014 I think we\u2019ve cut costs by almost 50% in the last five months,\u201d he added. \u201cContribution profit is the big focus for this year. We want to get that positive in all the countries in which we operate and in all products that we have.\u201d\nExpanding beyond credit\nJeeves\u2019 story runs counter to many others in the fintech world, where funding has dropped significantly and growth stories are harder to come by.\nAnd the startup\u2019s expansion helps round out its offering, said Thazhmon, to serve as \u201can all-in-one platform\u201d that combines accounts payable, invoicing, and spend management, with credit and prepaid cards, for companies operating across borders. That, he hopes, will only help it grow even more.\n\u201cBy launching prepaid cards and cross-border payments, our customers can move beyond employee expenses and use Jeeves for all corporate related expenses, including vendor payouts and invoicing,\u201d Thazhmon said.\nAs part of this new offering, Jeeves claims that it will allow customers to move funds in and out of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico within 24 hours \u2014 a process that has historically taken up to 7 days. On top of that, customers will have the ability to pay for operational expenses in over 150 countries in local currencies using multilanguage invoice-scanning technology.\nThe company wanted to expand beyond credit because customers were asking if they could also have the option to send money in the form of prefunded cards or customer deposits to fund their businesses in other countries.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking like is a bit like a global Bill.com where you have one component that\u2019s expense management and one that\u2019s accounts payable so it\u2019s much more robust than just a corporate card built on credit,\u201d Thazhmon said.\nIn May, Jeeves also completed full local card issuing in all 22 countries in which it operates, and the cards can be paid in local currency.\n\u201cThis is a really big differentiator because it means we\u2019re the only expense management company that can issue local cards in Latin America, North America and Europe,\u201d Thazhmon told TechCrunch. \u201cIt takes time to build rails in other countries. If you look at U.S.-based expense management platforms, they cannot onboard a company headquartered in Mexico. If you look at Mexican expense management providers, they cannot onboard a company [that] is headquartered in the US. Jeeves can do both.\u201d\nBuilding \u201ccountry by country\u201d\nJeeves was founded in 2020 under the premise that startups have traditionally had to rely on financial infrastructure that is local and country-specific. For example, a business with employees in Mexico and Colombia would require multiple vendors to cover its finance function in each country \u2014 a corporate card in Mexico and one in Colombia and another vendor for cross-border payments.\nThe company says it provides the underwriting, credit in local currency and the payment rails \u201cfor any business spend across countries and currencies.\u201d It currently has customers across 22 countries in North America, Latin America, the U.K. and Europe, including Kavak, dLocal, and Rappi. Nearly 60% of Jeeves\u2019 revenue is generated out of Colombia, Mexico and Brazil.\nThe company is a full principal member with Mastercard in those three countries and claims to be the only expense management provider with local bank identification numbers (BINs) in all 22 countries across the three continents where it operates. Jeeves says it can onboard companies headquartered in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and Europe.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve basically built this country by country in each region. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a big achievement,\u201d Thazhmon said. \u201cIt took about 18 months to kind of get this done.\u201d\nTo support its continued growth, Jeeves recently made a few high-profile new hires, including tapping Alex Melikian, previously at Payoneer, to serve as its CFO; hiring Daniel Adams, previously with Marqeta, to serve as chief compliance officer; and Lowell Isaacs, previously from Capital One, to serve as its VP of Credit Risk and Underwriting.\n\u201cOur long term goal is to go public,\u201d Thazhmon told TechCrunch. \u201cGiven we were in YC less than 3 years ago and launched officially just two years ago, the next stage for us includes scaling our leadership team with leaders that have public company experience, including knowing how to navigate a young fast growing startup into a scalable public company.\u201d\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

Developers must submit an application for a kit, provide details about their team\u2019s development skills and existing apps and agree to the terms and conditions before they\u2019ll be considered.\nIn the terms, Apple, which reserves the right to see a list of staff authorized to work on the dev kit, forbids family, friends, roommates and household employees from accessing, viewing or handling the Vision Pro. In addition, the terms bar developers from public discussion of the Vision Pro in person or on social media.\nIn addition to the headset hardware, approved developers will receive help setting up the Vision Pro and onboarding, check-ins with Apple experts for UI design and development guidance and assistance troubleshooting any issues with their code.\nApple says that priority will be given to \u201capplicants creating an app that takes advantage of visionOS features and capabilities\u201d \u2014 \u201cvisionOS,\u201d of course, referring to the OS that powers the Vision Pro.

Apple also released a compatibility checklist for ensuring that apps are ready for visionOS.\nThe Vision Pro, which was unveiled at Apple\u2019s annual WWDC conference in June, is expected to come to retail within the next few months priced at $3,499. The company\u2019s first major product launch since the Apple Watch in 2014, the Vision Pro is nothing if not ambitious, packing an array of sensors and cameras that enable what Apple\u2019s calling \u201cspatial computing\u201d experiences.\nAt launch, visionOS will feature apps \u2014 including Unity apps, which run natively on the Vision Pro \u2014 from Adobe (specifically Lightroom), Microsoft (Teams and Office), Netflix, Cisco (WebEx), Zoom and other major developers. There\u2019s medical software for looking at renders of anatomy and an engineering app for visualizing things like physics phenomena, like airflow, on top of real-world objects.\nThose apps and more will be hosted on a brand-new app store, which is launching simultaneously with the Vision Pro. Beyond apps, over 100 Apple Arcade titles will be available to play on VisionOS on \u201cday one,\u201d Apple says.\n",

        "content": "Twitter\u2019s rebranding to X has not been faring well. In addition to the haphazard rollout, which saw parts of the site referencing \u201cX\u201d while other parts still implored you to \u201csearch Twitter\u201d or push a blue button to \u201cTweet,\u201d the company also didn\u2019t secure the intellectual property rights to the X brand, Reuters reported. Plus, Twitter didn\u2019t get a permit to take down the Twitter sign from its San Francisco headquarters, requiring police intervention to stop the work. And, as TechCrunch discovered, the company didn\u2019t even make an attempt to secure the @x Twitter handle, owned by Gene X Hwang of the corporate photography and videography studio Orange Photography.\nThe @x account is currently set to private, but is referenced by the San Francisco-based @orangephoto account, which credits its founders by their Twitter handles \u201c@x & @jackhuynh,\u201d or Gene X Hwang and Jack Huynh, respectively.\nAccording to Hwang, no one from the company formerly known as Twitter has yet to reach out to him about the @x account he operates, but notes he would be happy to have a conversation if they ever did so.\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of waiting to see what might happen,\u201d Hwang tells TechCrunch. \u201cAnd I would be willing to part with the handle if they made an offer for it that made sense,\u201d he adds.\nHwang says he doesn\u2019t really have a solid figure in mind in terms of what the right price should be for parting with the account\u2019s name. For comparison, the prices for coveted Instagram handles tend to sell for thousands of dollars.\nBy all accounts, Twitter\u2019s rebranding to X seemed rushed, given the way events have played out in the hours since Elon Musk\u2019s announcement. Twitter\u2019s website and app hadn\u2019t fully removed all references to Twitter, and though the main @Twitter handle was rebranded as \u201cX\u201d the handle itself was still @twitter, users soon noticed.\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t even secure the handle before moving forward,\u201d remarked Twitter user @Nash076. \u201cReady shoot aim.\u201d\n\n\nWelcome to X. Now this is how you do a rebranding: pic.twitter.com/yCiN4hywrx\n\u2014 Fail Whale (@leederca) July 24, 2023\n\n\n\nwhen you're logged in to this website, you might be on X but you're searching Twitter pic.twitter.com/Du8cgVpmy5\n\u2014 Matt Binder (@MattBinder) July 24, 2023\n\nWhile Hwang waits to hear back to see if X or Musk will make him an offer \u2014 or perhaps just acquire his handle without consent (you never know these days!), others are digging into the intellectual property rights battles that X may now face. As Reuters and others reported, Microsoft has owned an X trademark since 2003 related to Xbox and Meta has owned a federal trademark since 2019 covering a blue-and-white letter \u201cX.\u201d While its logo looks different from Twitter\u2019s new X branding, Meta\u2019s trademark includes use with online social networking services, which may pose a problem.\nThough Meta may not decide to pursue legal action, trademark attorney Josh Gerben told Reuters there\u2019s a \u201c100% chance\u201d Twitter will be sued by somebody over the X rebranding, as he\u2019s counted nearly 900 active U.S. trademark registrations that cover X across various industries.\nBeyond the missteps with the rebranding itself, others are pointing out that Musk\u2019s move to rename Twitter \u201cX\u201d may involve a financial hit to the brand\u2019s value itself. Citing analysts and agencies, Fortune reports Musk may have wiped out $4 billion to $20 billion in Twitter\u2019s value \u2014 a brand that took 15-plus years to build.\n",

        "title": "Glowforge launches the Aura, a more accessible laser cutter",
        "content": "Laser cutters are nothing new, but Glowforge has a long history of adding something that the category has sorely been lacking: Ease of use. Today, the company announces the Aura. Smaller, cheaper and even easier to use than its bigger brother, the device is perfect for education, craft and light prototyping work.\nCarrying a $1,199 price tag, the Glowforge Aura can carve up wood, leather, acrylic, paper, stone, metal and other materials. The company doubles down on its ease of use by offering materials especially selected for the machine. The built-in camera reads the QR code, and the correct settings for cutting, scoring (i.e. marking but not cutting all the way through) and engraving are automatically selected by the machine. Of course, you\u2019re not limited to the materials provided by Glowforge, and you can use the machine\u2019s built-in settings as a starting point for your own craft projects.\nThe Aura can be vented out a window, or be paired with an air filter so it can be used indoors. The air filter automatically pairs with the Aura, and turns itself on to extract the smoke and fumes from the device when it\u2019s running. At least, that\u2019s the theory \u2014 in practice, I filled up my apartment with smoke a number of times when the air filter failed to come on.\nThe air filter was great when it worked. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t particularly consistent, and I found myself sitting in a cloud of wood smoke, wishing it just had a manual \u201con\u201d button as well as its smart features. The button that looks like an \u201con\u201d button, is not. Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch\nAfter a dozen emails back and forth with the customer support team, they sent out a new air filter \u2014 which worked more consistently, but also failed to turn on for a few of the cuts. Not ideal, but the team assures me that software updates will make the air filter more consistent over time. The issue also shows the downside of having a \u201cfoolproof\u201d system that\u2019s meant to \u201cjust work\u201d \u2014 if something goes wrong, I never found a way to manually turn the air filter on to extract smoke.\nUpdate:\u00a0Moments before this article went live, I got an email from Glowforge\u2019s CEO, Dan Shapiro, who tells me that they listened to my feedback, and implemented a way to manually run the air filter.\n\u201cWe just implemented your suggestion: if the printer isn\u2019t connected, the button turns teal and can be used as a switch to toggle between off, medium, and full power,\u201d Shapiro emailed me. \u201cThat should serve as a backup in case anyone in the future winds up here again. That update just went out so all new owners will have it.\u201d\nOn the right-hand side of the photo, contrasted against the chair: That\u2019s\u2026 a lot more smoke than I\u2019m comfortable having in my apartment. Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch\nThe aforementioned built-in camera makes the machine almost foolproof to use. With the web-based control software, you can see exactly where you\u2019re about to cut, and position your material just so. The software lets you select the type of cuts you want to make, along with the order of cuts \u2014 in my experience, engraving and cutting the inner parts of a complex design before cutting the outline of a print is usually the best way to go.\nThe problem is that the camera isn\u2019t super accurate. I\u2019ll get back to that when I try to engrave a phone case in just a moment, but even using Glowforge\u2019s official Proofgrade materials, there are quirks. Below, you can see a bunny I tried to cut; the software thinks I\u2019m well within the lines, but when cutting, the beastie\u2019s toes were dangling off the edge. That meant I had to reprint parts of it, wasting material.\nTrying to cut a bunny near the edge, but well within it\u2026 Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch\nOver the years, I\u2019ve used tons of different laser cutters, and most of them have something in common: They are fantastically powerful, but also very hard to use. Some of them need to be focused manually; others need to be carefully configured through trial and error whenever you use a new material. The Aura suffers from none of these issues.\nGlowforge\u2019s Aura is to laser cutters what the Cricut was to vinyl cutters: Professional users who are used to more industrial machines will be disappointed. The Aura has limited flexibility and can\u2019t be used for as many use cases as they might be used to. Overall, the Aura has all the advantages and disadvantages you\u2019d expect from a craft-grade device. The material thickness is limited, so if you want to laser engrave an item that\u2019s an inch thick, you\u2019re probably out of luck.\nI also ran into issues with materials that do, in theory, fit inside the Glowforge. I tried to laser-engrave a phone case, for example, but the first few attempts, it fired its lasers off the side of the case. After a fair amount of trial and error, I was able to get it all set up and calibrated as expected. Still, if part of the target audience of the Aura is students and makers, phone cases seem like a pretty obvious choice.\nI tried a tiny one-millimeter test score to see if the laser was outputting the right power. Hilariously, the Aura tried to cut about 10mm next to its target area, time and time again. Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch\nEventually, I asked the Aura to draw a circle around the Apple logo on my phone. The alignment is off, but in addition to that, it looks like the laser didn\u2019t focus properly (the line should be a lot thinner than that), resulting in one ruined leather phone case. Womp-womp. Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch\nThe professional in me is annoyed that the Aura doesn\u2019t have an \u201coutline print\u201d feature found on professional lasers: This would make the laser do a low-output pass over the outside of the print area. It won\u2019t mark the material, but it does show whether it is aligned properly. I\u2019m also annoyed that I couldn\u2019t find a way to focus the laser manually.\nStill, whining about these limitations does a disservice to the Aura \u2014 it doesn\u2019t pretend to be a professional tool. In its press materials, the company describes it as a \u201ccraft machine,\u201d and positions itself as a replacement for craft cutters: Replacing razor blades with a beam of light, essentially.\u00a0\nGlowforge\u2019s software comes with a number of fonts that are great for making stencils. In the foreground: One of the functional parts I made with plywood, dowels and wood glue. Image Credits: Haje Kamps / TechCrunch\nTime will tell whether that positioning works, but I suspect it isn\u2019t an accident that the company is trying to go downmarket: The advanced amateur market is covered by the original Glowforge machines; the $7,000 Pro, or the $5,000 Plus. Neither of those price points are particularly hobbyist friendly, and the $1,200 price point puts it within reach of maker spaces, hobbyists and crafters who see the need for creating repeatable patterns on the fly.\nGlowforge Aura also works the Magic Canvas functionality I covered a while back, which removes even the need to be able to design your own prints. Magic Canvas transforms simple descriptions into tangible art forms like hardwood jewelry, slate coasters and more. Perfect for the crafting and doing-a-project-with-the-kids market, Magic Canvas can generate custom clip-art in tons of different styles, making crafting even more accessible than before.\n\nLaser-focused on creativity, Glowforge adds AI image generation\n\nIn reviewing the device, I played with a number of different materials, but in the end I ended up cutting more paper than I was expecting, and using the paper as spray-paint stencils. I also cut a fair few functional parts that I would have otherwise 3D printed, but I realized that stacking plywood with dowels and wood glue to hold it all together made parts that were both sturdier and faster to produce \u2014 not to mention more resistant to heat \u2014 than parts made with a 3D printer.\nGlowforge\u2019s Aura isn\u2019t the cheapest laser cutter out there, but it packs many ease-of-use and safety features into a relatively affordable package. The teenager in me really wishes these things were around when I was a teenager; it would have been really fun to learn to craft and create with one of these.\nThe Aura goes on sale today, and can be purchased through retailers JOANN, Michaels, and HSN.\n",

        "content": "\nThe Avalanche Foundation is allocating up to $50 million to purchase tokenized assets created on its layer-1 blockchain, the company exclusively told TechCrunch.\nThe initiative, Avalanche Vista, aims to highlight the value of tokenization in different sectors like equity, credit, real estate and commodities.\nTokenization is the process of creating a digital representation of a real-world asset (RWA) on a blockchain. \u201cIt creates a faster, more efficient way for companies to issue assets, individuals to own them, and everyone to transfer value,\u201d John Wu, president of Ava Labs, the firm that created Avalanche, told TechCrunch.\nThis isn\u2019t the firm\u2019s first rodeo in the asset tokenization space. In September, KKR, one of the biggest investment management firms in the U.S., tokenized a part of its private equity fund on Avalanche\u2019s blockchain through digital assets securities firm Securitize.\n\nAvalanche wants to digitize all of the world\u2019s assets on the blockchain\n\n\u201cOur mission is to tokenize the world\u2019s assets,\u201d Wu said. \u201cVista is our next show of commitment to do that. It\u2019s not just dollars involved, but commitment to help web2 players work with us and explain tokenization.\u201d\nTokenization can provide a number of different benefits, but Wu said the focus is to provide operational efficiency, accessibility to new users and improved liquidity.\nUnlike traditional financial rails, blockchain settlements can be done instantly, and investors can see where assets are stored on-chain because of its transparent nature.\n\u201cPeople are seeing that this concept of instant settlement doesn\u2019t really exist in the real world,\u201d Wu said. \u201cClearing in a traditional system takes a couple of days, and that\u2019s trillions and billions locked up for a period of time. That can be done in a more efficient manner [on the blockchain] instantly.\u201d\nBlockchains can already provide operational efficiency by streamlining, automating workflows and removing intermediaries. Accessibility is still a work in progress, with initiatives on the rise like the KKR tokenization, bringing highly regulated entities into the space to allow for new investments, Wu said.\nBut the reality is, the hardest part of tokenization right now is liquidity, Wu said. \u201cYou have to prove the efficiency and accessibility at scale before liquidity happens.\u201d\nFrom the many deals Ava Labs has explored with traditional players, \u201cthe weakest link in that tripod was the liquidity aspect,\u201d Wu said. So the company decided to invest $50 million, in line with what it sees in the pipeline and how much is needed to improve liquidity, he added.\nToday, the most common tokenized asset types are equities and real estate, according to a recent Digital Asset Research report. Of the 41 centralized finance RWA organizations highlighted in the report, 26 have their own tokenized asset marketplaces and 30 support the fractionalization of RWA.\nWu sees tokenization of assets on the blockchain as one of the most impactful innovations of the next decade, and he is not alone in thinking that way.\nLarry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, said in March, that \u201cthe next generation for markets, the next generation for securities, will be tokenization of securities.\u201d Blackrock had $8.5 trillion in assets under management as of 2022, and while all of that won\u2019t be tokenized, allocating even just 0.1% of that amount for tokenization would make up a whopping $850 million.\nTyrone Lobban, head of blockchain at JPMorgan\u2019s Onyx, last year shared the bank\u2019s plan to implement institutional-grade DeFi, saying he believes there\u2019s significant value for tokenization of assets waiting on the sidelines.\n\u201cOver time, we think [of] tokenizing U.S. Treasurys or money market fund shares, for example, means these could all potentially be used as collateral in DeFi pools,\u201d Lobban said. \u201cThe overall goal is to bring these trillions of dollars of assets into DeFi, so that we can use these new mechanisms for trading, borrowing [and] lending, but with the scale of institutional assets.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also potential for tokenization of non-financial assets to grow, Wu said, noting that loyalty reward points on blockchains are becoming popular. In April, Ava Labs partnered with Korean data management and marketing platform SK Planet to help it expand customer and merchant rewards, among other things, on Avalanche\u2019s blockchain.\nGoing forward, there\u2019s a \u201clong pipeline of deals\u201d with partners in the works to alleviate tokenization liquidity over the next 12 to 18 months, Wu said. \u201cTokenization is going to be adopted and now is the right time to do this.\u201d\n",

        "content": "When Nexla launched a data operations platform at TechCrunch Disrupt Battlefield in 2017, building applications on top of that data was not necessarily a well understood concept. As time has gone on, however, the company has matured alongside the machine learning market, and today it\u2019s able to help customers build applications based on the data that Nexla manages and processes.\nAs it has done this, it has grown slowly and steadily, attaining cash-flow positive status much earlier than most startups. As founder and CEO Saket Saurabh told TechCrunch, the company did that at a time when burning large amounts of venture capital was the way to do things.\nSaurabh chose to grow his company differently, and when investors began looking for efficiency over growth as we turned to 2023, Nexla was well positioned for this change. Today, the company was rewarded with an $18 million investment.\nHe says that putting the data inside his software to work is the end goal now. \u201cSo we ended up with this very powerful concept of data products that we have built out and the data product has become a central thing that then enables you to integrate the data in Nexla to share the data and collaborate with it,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\nThe applications approach has become so central to what the company is doing, they have begun offering an organized way to distribute them. \u201cWe recently launched the ability to take these data products in an organization and put them into an internal marketplace where employees can discover and make use of them,\u201d Saurabh said.\nHe pointed out that his company has plenty of cash being generated from sales, and hadn\u2019t spent much of the previous round, but when investors came knocking, he had to pay attention, especially at a time where many startups are having a hard time raising money. Without a ton of effort, he said that the company had an oversubscribed round.\nPerhaps that\u2019s because the startup reports big-name customers like DoorDash, Johnson & Johnson, LinkedIn and American Express. It\u2019s also growing with almost 100 employees, and is hiring with plans to hit 150 in the next eight to nine months.\nHe says that by having a mix of remote and hybrid work, he\u2019s been able to create a more diverse employee base, as opposed to being confined to one geographical area. \u201cIt has improved our diversity a lot, especially internationally speaking, where [many of] our hires are coming from. So both gender diversity and general background diversity are actually significantly improved with this approach,\u201d he said.\nToday\u2019s $18 million investment was led by Shield Capital with participation from existing investors Blumberg Capital, Engineering Capital, Storm Ventures, Industry Ventures and Liberty Global. Shield Capital partner Mike Brown will be joining the Nexla board under the terms of the agreement.\n",

        "content": "After staying in invite-only mode for more than a year, The Browser Company\u2019s Arc browser is now available to everyone. The company is bumping up the browser version number to 1.0 with this announcement. It also unveiled a revamped website to promote the public launch.\nCurrently, Arc is currently only available for Mac users, but the company is planning to launch a Windows version later this year. It offers a companion app for mobile devices, but it\u2019s not a full browser.\nThe Browser Company was founded by Branch co-founders and former Facebook employees Josh Miller and Hursh Agrawal in 2019. In 2021, it raised $5 million from high-profile investors, such as LinkedIn\u2019s Jeff Weiner, Medium\u2019s Ev Williams and Figma\u2019s Dylan Field, in an attempt to build a new web browsing experience.\nWhat the heck is an Arc browser?\nThe Browser Company uses Chromium as the base architecture for the Arc browser, which allows users to easily port saved bookmarks, logins and extensions.\nHowever, new users could potentially face a steep learning curve given that it has a different way of treating tabs \u2014 they look more like applications. If you get used to getting around the browser using keyboard shortcuts, life with Arc will be easier. It\u2019s somewhat of a \u201cnerdy\u201d product, so there are a number of customizable shortcuts for different actions.\nImage Credits: Arc Browser\nIn Arc, you can create different \u201cSpaces\u201d like \u201cWork,\u201d \u201cEntertainment,\u201d \u201cVacation\u201d and \u201cNotetaking\u201d to store different tabs related to them so you can quickly access them. You can pin six tabs (sites) that are common across spaces, and you can also pin tabs inside of spaces. Plus, this new browser has built-in note-taking and whiteboard tools. I know, it\u2019s complicated.\nIts approach of putting tabs in the sidebar and archiving them rather than closing them altogether might push people to give up within a few hours of using it. The company hopes that the revamped website gives more information about the browser before people even try it out, making the learning curve easier.\n\nWhat have they rolled out in the past few months?\nWhile Arc is designed to be a desktop browser, they rolled out an iPhone app in March that helps you put tabs into spaces while browsing on mobile, so you can access them later.\nThe company also rolled out a fun feature called Boosts that lets you change the theme and layout of a website \u2014 including removing some sections and buttons \u2014 without any coding skills.\nChrome on the left and Arc on the right\u00a0Image Credits: Screenshot by TechCrunch\nOver the last few weeks, Arc also introduced a toolbar that lives atop the browser window, making accessing the URL bar and site settings easier. Before this, users had to go to the sidebar to access these features.\nImage Credits: Arc Browser\nThe company has additionally introduced picture-in-picture support for Google Meet, a per-site control center to enable or disable boosts, developer mode and picture-in-picture settings. And it\u2019s made tweaks to improve multi-window support along with speed improvements.\nMany browsers in the market, including Microsoft Edge, Opera and Sigma OS, have integrated an AI assistant. Arc is also thinking about integrating AI into its browser, it says. The company recently showed off a demo about how AI could help Arc users change some elements of the website. Those features may come in time as The Browser Company plans to ship more updates and new features after this v1 release.\n\nChrome competitor, The Browser Company, quietly raises $5M\n\n",

        "content": "As organizations grow, it becomes harder to understand what\u2019s happening operationally across departments inside a company. We tend to use meetings to try and figure out what others are doing, which isn\u2019t terribly efficient. Akooda is an early-stage startup trying to help solve that problem by using AI to analyze the company\u2019s internal software stack to better understand the inner workings of the organization without having to meet to figure it out \u2014 or at least meet less.\nEmployees can instead use generative AI to ask questions about the data Akooda is compiling. Today, the company announced an $11 million seed investment.\nAkooda CEO Yuval Gonczarowski says that his company looks at the SaaS tools running inside an organization and builds a picture of what\u2019s happening operationally across the company. \u201cWe connect to the entire public digital footprint of your organization including public Slack messages, Confluence documentation, pieces of code, sales entries in Salesforce and HubSpot, JIRA tickets \u2014 anything where knowledge is created in the company,\u201d Gonczarowski told TechCrunch.\nHe says that the software tears this information apart, then builds it back up in a way that makes sense for individuals and managers to ask any questions they want about their organization, giving a ChatGPT kind of experience to better understand the details they might not normally have access to without a lot of tedious meetings and reporting.\nWhile the company is using large language models to achieve this level of understanding, Gonczarowski says it\u2019s more nuanced than that because he doesn\u2019t want to use a company\u2019s private data to train the models. Instead they turn to statistical modeling and analysis to look at the customer\u2019s unique lexicon, what they call the company\u2019s \u201crare words.\u201d Akooda analyzes each company\u2019s own internal lingo \u2014 its acronyms, project names and customer names, he says. This helps personalize the software for each company and industry without explicitly using their data to train the models.\nThe next step on the product roadmap will take the software from simply answering questions to tease out information about the company and add an anomaly detection engine to surface potential problems in an automated fashion. So for example, if the software detects that a low-revenue customer is taking up a lot of internal resources, it may flag that for managers. A human could potentially find that same information if they knew to ask the right questions, but having the AI tell the manager is going to be more efficient (assuming it reports on meaningful issues).\nHe says this still involves human decision makers, but it\u2019s giving them better information on which to base their decisions. \u201cIf I look at things from a more theoretical level, an abstracted level, the role of the human in the loop is not going to change. We are still the conscientious decision makers, but collecting the data and putting those things on the table that will allow us to make a decision is something that is fundamentally going to change the way we manage companies,\u201d he said.\nThe company currently has 16 employees and is hiring for some open roles. Gonczarowski says that he has been managing people throughout his career, and he sees diversity as a natural by-product of how you hire. \u201cThere is a very simple way to do that: you hire the best and you give everyone a fair chance and then it just happens. And that\u2019s my leadership\u2019s approach,\u201d he said.\nAs an example he has been part of an initiative inside Israel to hire Russian and Ukrainian immigrants coming to Israel. \u201cThat is an initiative that we took an active part in from Day Zero. It\u2019s something that we hold very near and dear to our hearts.\u201d\nToday\u2019s investment came from a variety of firms including NFX, Atlassian Ventures, Village Global and Founder Collective, as well as other unnamed angels.\n",

        "content": "The fund-of-funds model has a new role to play in the venture ecosystem as the amount of capital allotted to such funds has declined over the years. And as its role changes, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if this new version is helping diverse and emerging fund managers.\nForget, for a moment, the pros and cons of the model itself \u2014 my colleague Rebecca has already covered that. Think instead of the actual premise of a fund of funds (FoF): Investors and LPs back such funds as a way to enter a market, sometimes to get into early-stage deals, as they can use the funds\u2019 broad base to spread risk. So if an investor is already adjusting for risk, why not back diverse and emerging fund managers who are doing the same thing as any other manager: placing bets and hoping for high returns?\nIf the problem is that diverse fund managers are riskier, for whatever reason, then the FoF model should give an added layer of protection should everything go astray. Typically, FOFs do good diligence, meaning the level of diligence will be lower for the LPs looking to invest in the funds backed by the FoFs. This might be a plus for some investors.\nAn easy way to see how a prospective fund is doing is to simply ask them: schedule a call to connect. Or ask a friend what they\u2019ve heard about so-and-so. Literally, just go out there and get them. A lot of diverse fund managers fit into the emerging fund manager bucket, and they are not going to turn down an established investor.\nAfter all, it\u2019s a tough market out there, as Sara Zulkosky, managing partner at Recast Capital, a U.S.-based fund of funds, points out.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen firsthand that it can take diverse-led venture firms over twice as long to raise their funds. Many emerging managers, raising more modest fund sizes, are raising from high-net-worth individuals, family offices and other institutions via modest check sizes,\u201d she told TechCrunch+. \u201cFoFs, specifically those focused on emerging managers, can oftentimes write more substantial checks and help to accelerate a fund.\u201d",

        "content": "Amazon is lowering its acquisition price for robotic vacuum-maker iRobot, after the duo have hit regulatory snags trying to get the deal over the line.\nThe e-commerce giant announced plans to acquire iRobot last August in an all-cash deal worth $1.7 billion, equating to around $61 per share. Now, Amazon has said that it\u2019s amending its bid to $51.75, roughly 15% lower than its initial offer.\nThe reason stems from the ongoing antitrust headwinds that companies have faced both domestically and in Europe, which has seemingly impacted iRobot\u2019s bottom line. Indeed, iRobot has said that it is having to raise $200 million in debt to \u201cfund its ongoing operations,\u201d a debt that Amazon will take on when (or if) the deal finally closes \u2014 and that is why it has tabled a new lower bid for iRobot.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached an amended agreement with Amazon that reflects the incurrence of iRobot\u2019s new debt,\u201d iRobot CEO Colin Angle said in a statement. \u201ciRobot is taking on new financing that we believe is sufficient to support our operations in a hyper competitive environment and meet our liquidity needs as well as pay off iRobot\u2019s existing debt.\u201d\nScrutiny\nAmazon\u2019s megabucks iRobot deal was always likely to attract regulatory scrutiny. While the U.K. finally approved the acquisition last month, the European Commission (EC) confirmed a few weeks later that it would be pushing ahead with a more in-depth probe \u2014 this won\u2019t be resolved until November at the very earliest. In the U.S., meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is also mulling\u00a0an official investigation into the deal.\nThere could be any number of twists and turns before this acquisition finally clears. Europe recently greenlighted both Microsoft\u2019s Activision acquisition and Broadcom\u2019s VMware acquisition following in-depth probes, a sign that the Bloc is keen to seek remedies rather than block deals outright. In the U.S., meanwhile, a judge recently ruled that the FTC can\u2019t block the Microsoft / Activision merger, despite its best efforts.\nIt seems more likely than not that Amazon\u2019s iRobot acquisition will get over the line, assuming it can convince regulators that it won\u2019t restrict competition in the robotic vacuum cleaner market.\nHowever, with today\u2019s news, the merger now has another hurdle to circumvent \u2014 convincing iRobot\u2019s shareholders to agree to the revised price. The new offer represents a premium of just 2% on iRobot\u2019s trading price before Amazon swooped in last August, down from the 20% premium shareholders originally agreed to.\nHowever, the deal is so far down the road now, it would seem unlikely that shareholders would block the deal at this juncture.\n",

The delivery app announced today that Grubhub+ is getting new rewards, such as a 5% credit back on pickup orders, lower service fees, milestone rewards and a new Shell offering for members participating in the Fuel Rewards program, among other perks.\nThe credit back feature on pickup orders is a decent addition to the membership as users previously could only get 10% cash back on eligible delivery orders.\nThe main reason Grubhub introduced the new pickup reward is because it found that more diners opt for pickup as it\u2019s a more affordable option, the company says. In general, 37% more consumers\u00a0in the U.S. used the pickup option for their most recent orders in 2022 than in 2021, per e-commerce website PYMNTS and payment service provider Cybersource.\nMilestone rewards will be available in the coming months to help users \u201ccelebrate some of life\u2019s most joyful moments,\u201d Grubhub wrote in the official announcement. Examples include a birthday or anniversary, the company told us.\nAdditionally, Grubhub\u2019s new partner offer with Shell gives members instant Gold Status in the Fuel Rewards program, saving them 5 cents per gallon on every fill-up when they link their Fuel Rewards account.\nWhile Grubhub declined to share specific numbers regarding lower service fees, the company told TechCrunch that \u201cmembers will feel significant savings.\u201d\nImage Credits: Grubhub\n\u201cWe continually gather feedback from our diners, and they\u2019ve told us they want more value, recognition and elevated service from their subscription programs,\u201d said Launika Raykar, vice president, loyalty, customer engagement and partnerships at Grubhub. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve offered with the relaunch of Grubhub+.\u201d\nAs competition continues to heat up across the meal delivery industry \u2014 with rivals like DoorDash and Uber Eats offering similar loyalty programs \u2014 the relaunch is likely Grubhub\u2019s way of retaining users as well as convincing new members to try the service.\nGrubhub+ was initially launched in 2020 to provide diners with perks like free delivery on orders $12 and up, member-only offers and more.

Right now it is deployed across the Shopify ecosystem.\nAll of that is managed by its ExperienceEngine, an AI-powered system where merchants can perform marketing procedures, like A/B testing, and then leverage predictive analytics and machine-learning models to make better decisions on how to deploy them. For example, one of Stay Ai\u2019s clients, Olipop, was able to increase subscriber revenue by 35% within 90 days of beginning to use Stay Ai\u2019s tools.\nStay Ai\u2019s merchant portal. Image Credits: Stay Ai\n\u201cWith cancellations typically, the highest cancellations happen between order No. 1 and order No. 2,\u201d CEO Perrelli told TechCrunch. \u201cSo, how do we get that number down so that you actually become profitable? It can be as easy as telling customers on an upcoming notification that they were going to get a gift, which made them hold out one more order, this is typically where brands become profitable on a subscription purchase. Getting them over that hump is a huge game-changer.\u201d\nAfter launching a year ago, Stay Ai is now used by approximately 300 Shopify merchants, including Vita Coco, Momofuku and Snow, while revenue is pacing 10x from 2022, Perrelli said. The company charges a $500-per-month fee for users and then takes 1% and 19 cents for all subscription transactions.\nBuilding on top of Shopify has been popular lately, with startups like Polar Analytics, Triple Whale, Replo, Postscript,\u00a0Shop Circle\u00a0and\u00a0Popup attracting venture capital interest within the past year for their tools targeting merchants on the marketplace. Stay Ai is the latest company to join that list announcing $15.1 million in Series A capital to build on its growth. The investment included $8.6 million led by Telescope Partners, with participation from Boulder Food Group, Riverpark Ventures and Vanterra Capital, and a previously undisclosed $7.5 million that was led by Watchfire Ventures and a group of individuals, including Sharma Brands founder Nik Sharma and Postscript founder Adam Turner.\nStay Ai intends to use the new funding to expand on its team of 50, accelerating its innovation roadmap and additional acquisitions. In the past year that included an acquisition of churn reduction app RetentionEngine.\n\u201cWith the acquisition of Bellwethr, we are layering more machine learning into our tools,\u201d Perrelli said. \u201cFor some average A/B tests, we get about a 20%, sometimes 30%, churn reduction.

        "content": "Hackers exploited a zero-day flaw in Ivanti\u2019s mobile endpoint management software to compromise a dozen Norwegian government agencies \u2014 and thousands of other organizations could also be at risk.\nThe Norwegian Security and Service Organization (DSS) said in a statement on Monday that a \u201cdata attack\u201d had struck the IT platform used by 12 government ministries. The Norwegian government did not name the affected ministries, but the DSS confirmed several offices were unaffected, including Norway\u2019s Prime Minister\u2019s Office, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nThe DSS said the attack was the result of a \u201cpreviously unknown vulnerability in the software of one of our suppliers,\u201d but didn\u2019t share any further details. However, the Norwegian National Security Authority (NSM) later confirmed that hackers had leveraged the previously undiscovered flaw in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM; formerly MobileIron Core), to compromise Norwegian government agencies.\nSofie Nystr\u00f8m, director general of Norway\u2019s NSM, said the government couldn\u2019t initially disclose the vulnerability due to \u201csecurity reasons,\u201d noting that the security flaw was discovered for the \u201cfirst time here in Norway.\u201d\nIvanti\u2019s EPMM allows authorized users and devices to access a corporate or government network. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-35078, is an authentication bypass flaw that affects all supported versions of Ivanti\u2019s EPMM software, along with older and unsupported releases. If exploited, the vulnerability allows anyone over the internet to remotely access the software \u2014 without needing credentials \u2014 to access users\u2019 personal information, such as names, phone numbers and other mobile device details for users on a vulnerable system, as well as make changes to the impacted server.\nIn an alert published on Monday, the U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA warned that attackers could create an EPMM administrative account, enabling them to make further changes to a vulnerable system.\nIn a statement to TechCrunch, Ivanti chief security officer Daniel Spicer said that after the company became aware of the vulnerability, it \u201cimmediately developed and released a patch and are actively engaging with customers to help them apply the fix,\u201d adding that \u201cwe are upholding our commitment to deliver and maintain secure products, while practicing responsible disclosure protocols.\u201d\nHowever, Ivanti initially kept details of the flaw \u2014 which has been given a maximum vulnerability severity rating out 10 out of 10 \u2014 behind a paywall, and reportedly asked potentially impacted customers to accept non-disclosure terms before sharing details. At the time of writing, Ivanti\u2019s Knowledge Base article about the vulnerability still requires users to login before viewing.\nIn a short public-facing alert, Ivanti confirmed that it is \u201caware of a very limited number of customers that have been impacted.\u201d When asked by TechCrunch, the company declined to say exactly how many customers have been impacted or whether it has seen any evidence of data exfiltration as a result of the attacks.\nNorway\u2019s NSM confirmed that it had notified the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (DPA) about the attack targeting government ministries, suggesting that hackers may have exfiltrated sensitive data from compromised systems.\nThe full extent of the fallout from this zero-day remains to be seen, but many more organizations could be at risk if patches are not applied. According to Shodan, \u200ba search engine for publicly exposed devices, there are more than 2,900 MobileIron portals exposed to the internet, the majority of which are located in the United States.\nAs noted by cybersecurity researcher Kevin Beaumont, the vast majority of impacted organizations \u2014 a list which includes numerous U.S. and U.K. government departments \u2014 have not yet been patched.\n\nHackers exploit Citrix zero-day to target US critical infrastructure\n\n",

It\u2019s a substantial market, too, expected to be valued at $25.4 billion by 2033.\nBrevel, a Tel Aviv\u2013based company, is developing microalgae into an alternative protein and today announced $18.5 million in seed funding.\nFounded in 2016 by three brothers, Yonatan Golan, Matan Golan and Ido Golan, Brevel developed a proprietary technology that combines fermentation and light to make a protein from microalgae that is sold to food companies as a powder for use in plant-based products.\nThe company claims the protein is \u201cthe most sustainable on earth\u201d and can be considered a \u201cghost protein\u201d because it doesn\u2019t affect the flavor, color or taste of foods and therefore can be used in a wide variety of food applications.\nIn addition, that method helps the company achieve cost parity with plant-based proteins like pea and soy because it can generate co-products alongside the protein, including functional lipids and pigments, according to the company.\nBrevel is one of numerous companies using microalgae for food products, like AlgaeCore Technologies, Algenuity and NewFish.\nFor its part, Brevel will leverage the new funds into the continued development of its protein. The company is initially targeting the dairy alternative sector and currently operates a 500-liter pilot in Israel and will move into a commercial-scale factory with the capacity of a 5,000-liter fermentation and light system.\nBeyond that, the company is preparing to build an even larger facility with a total capacity of 900,000 liters, planned for 2025.\nBrevel recently signed an agreement with Vgarden, a plant-based cheese company, which will be the first to incorporate Brevel\u2019s protein into its plant-based cheese. The first products are expected to be on shelves in 2024.\nNevaTeam Partners led the seed round, which included $8.4 million raised in June 2022 that converted from grants and convertible loans into shares.

        "content": "Solink, a company that provides physical security systems for businesses, including closed-circuit camera analytics, today announced that it raised $60 million in a Series C round led by Goldman Sachs with participation from Omers Ventures and BDC IT Ventures.\nCo-founder and CEO Michael Matta said the cash will be put toward growing Solink\u2019s client base globally and investing in new products.\n\u201cSolink\u2019s platform meets the unique needs of different industries by offering a solution for forensic security and real-time active security monitoring,\u201d Matta told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cCustomers across a range of industries use Solink to maximize the value of their existing surveillance infrastructure investments while Solink\u2019s cloud-native infrastructure allows for deeper integration with other business systems, enabling new use cases and improving efficiency.\u201d\nSolink was founded in 2010 as a consulting group to help banks and credit unions combat ATM fraud. Combining transaction activity from ATMs with security camera data, the company\u2019s platform helped identify potential ATM skimming attacks in real time.\nIn 2016, Solink expanded into cloud video security, launching a service-based offering that enriched video feeds with data from other systems, including point-of-sales systems. Today, Solink\u2019s platform allows companies to perform a range of security monitoring tasks, like detecting motion across cameras and navigating from one camera to another without having to know a physical site\u2019s layout.\n\u201cCustomers can add an unlimited number of users under one subscription and assign unique levels of permissions depending on rank and role,\u201d Matta explained. \u201cThe system is configurable, automatically adapting as cameras are added or repositioned, and has the ability to add, remove or modify links manually if required.\u201d\nBut to this writer, some of the applications of Solink\u2019s service are downright creepy.\nIn restaurants and retail environments \u2014 say, clothing stores \u2014 Solink claims to be able to tag specific staff\u2019s customer interactions and monitor per-staff transactions for speed and size, or filter for \u201cunusual\u201d behavior and movement (e.g., foot traffic) in a room. The company also claims that it can identify \u201cthreats\u201d using AI, including unauthorized access to buildings and attempted break-ins, and has partnerships with law enforcement for dispatch.\nIt\u2019s not hard to envision a scenario where a customer uses Solink to invasively surveil their employees \u2014 and their customers, for that matter. It wouldn\u2019t be illegal \u2014 businesses have a wide berth where it concerns monitoring their workplaces, at least in the U.S. But staffers and patrons might have\u2026thoughts about it.\nImage Credits: Solink\nThe AI component is particularly concerning, considering what history has taught us about AI tech\u2019s susceptibility to bias and other flaws. Consider an algorithm trained to spot \u201csuspicious\u201d activity from a shopper. If the dataset used to train it was imbalanced \u2014 say, if it contained an overwhelming amount of footage of Black shoppers stealing \u2014 it\u2019d likely flag the overrepresented shoppers more often than others.\nSolink says that \u201ccertified dispatchers\u201d review video alerts from customers to prevent false alarms and don\u2019t contact emergency services without approval. One wonders, though, how frequently those dispatchers become overwhelmed with alerts \u2014 leading to mistakes.\nThen there\u2019s the hacking potential. Solink asserts that its platform is highly robust against attacks. But any camera network put on the cloud becomes a potential target for malicious actors. (See: the 2021 breach of Silicon Valley security cam startup Verkada.)\nOf course, short of a peek at Solink\u2019s internal metrics, it\u2019s impossible to say where any flaws in the system exist. But that doesn\u2019t appear to have dissuaded customers from signing up for the service.\nSolink says its system is monitoring more than 18,000 locations worldwide for more than 800 brands, including Tim Hortons, The Container Store and PGA Tour Superstore. Matta credits the pandemic with the uptake, in part.\n\u201cThe effect of the pandemic on our business was unusual compared to many others,\u201d Matta said. \u201cFirst, while many of our customers were slowing down on growth, their usage of the Solink platform increased 3x \u2014 mainly because they had to manage their business without being on-site. Second, customers we had that didn\u2019t have Solink in all their locations wanted to add more and we saw rapid expansion without our existing base. Third, customers who were using Solink only for video and security started using it to increase performance, ensuring inventory was in the right place, that employees were properly wearing protective equipment and more.\u201d\nTo be sure, the market for cloud-managed video surveillance, also known as video surveillance-as-a-service, is growing. A report from Novaira Insights predicts that the sector will grow to $27 billion in 2023, dominated by four suppliers \u2014 Hikvision, Dahua, Axis Communications and Motorola Solutions.\nTo date, Solink, which employs around 230 people, has raised $90 million in venture capital.\n",

        "content": "In-space logistics startup Atomos Space will launch its first demonstration mission on SpaceX\u2019s Transporter-10 in the first quarter of 2024, as the company looks to gain an early foothold in the emerging market for orbital transfer services.\nThe five-year-old company will send up two spacecraft, an orbital transfer vehicle (OTV) called Quark and a target vehicle, Gluon. After separating from SpaceX\u2019s Falcon 9 rocket, Quark will attempt to autonomously rendezvous and dock with Gluon, and then refuel from the target vehicle. During the mission, the two spacecraft will attempt to demonstrate additional maneuvers, including release, re-docking and orbital transfer.\nThe two spacecraft will essentially demonstrate the method by which Atomos intends to deploy large satellite constellations, whereby customer payloads will be integrated to Gluon for launch and captured in-orbit by Quark.\nThese maneuvers are extremely technically challenging but could be a game-changer for the economics of operating spacecraft on-orbit, Atomos co-founder and CEO Vanessa Clark said in a recent interview.\n\u201cBeing able to rendezvous with spacecraft in this manner is like our SpaceX-landing-the-Falcon-9-first-stage moment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt changes the equation in terms of cost for in-space transportation and mobility, and the services that we can provide.\u201d\nAtomos, which has raised over $26 million since its founding, is taking a slightly different approach to in-space transportation than some of its competitors, Clark said. As opposed to launching expendable OTVs as kick stages, Atomos\u2019 approach is to use \u201cspace resident\u201d OTVs that are already in orbit, ready to move satellites around. Designing a reusable spacecraft that rendezvous with payload on orbit also drives the cost down for both Atomos and their customers, Clark said: The customer can maximize launch costs by putting more mass in the rocket payload fairing.\n\u201cThe analogy is that we\u2019re putting really efficient last-mile delivery vans at the airport rather than flying the delivery van from the departure airport with all of the payloads,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe can reduce the number of flights we need and increase the payload we take.\u201d\nThe company is also taking a vertically integrated approach, building both the OTV and the target vehicle for rendezvous. Atomos had been working with a bus vendor but decided to move the design and manufacturing of the spacecraft and much of its subsystems in-house last summer.\nIssues that have emerged during other companies\u2019 attempts to demonstrate on-orbit rendezvous are the result of a lack of vertical integration, Clark argued.\n\u201cChallenges arise when the whole system isn\u2019t familiar to your engineering team, and you\u2019re compromised in your ability to do integrated testing on the ground to make sure every little piece works together,\u201d she said.\nAfter this demonstration mission, Atomos plans to launch a full-powered Quark to enter commercial service, and to further develop a separate OTV, Quark Mark II, that will have robotic arms and will be capable of serving customers in geosynchronous orbit.\nLonger term, Atomos is also looking to differentiate itself via its ongoing investment in nuclear propulsion. While that capability won\u2019t come online any time soon, it is the \u201cend state\u201d toward which the company is scaling, Atomos co-founder and COO William Kowalski said.\n\u201cEveryone recognizes this is a required capability,\u201d he said.\nAtomos is planning to launch a pathfinder mission testing a low-power fission reactor in-orbit sometime in the next few years. Though it will chiefly be a technology demonstration, Kowalski said the mission would also serve to cut through many of the complex and murky regulations around nuclear power.\n\u201cIf you really want to move around, even within Earth orbits, moving around, the way we all envision is going to require significantly more power, he said. \u201cChemical systems are just not going to be able to do it.\u201d\n",

After uploading a picture of the space they want to redesign, the app enables them to transform the space with styles like \u201cModern Farmhouse,\u201d \u201cBohemian\u201d or \u201cIndustrial.\u201d\nAccording to Shrenik Sadalgi, director of R&D at Wayfair, the infrastructure behind Decorify has been in the works for some time. But the advent of image-generating AI diffusion models such as OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 2 brought it over the finish line, improving the quality of the generated images to the point where Wayfair saw it fit to ship.\n\u201cOur hypothesis is that the quality is good enough to drive value for a customer,\u201d Sadalgi told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cWayfair\u2019s customers are looking for, and love, visual inspiration \u2014 they get that from our rich lifestyle imagery that we custom produce and curate. Now they can blend that with their spaces.\u201d\nDecorify, which doesn\u2019t require downloading a dedicated app, is pretty easy to use. After launching Decorify on the web (on desktop or mobile) and logging in with a Google or GitHub account or an email address, the app prompts you to upload a photo of your space.\nFor now, Decorify only supports living rooms, disappointingly \u2014 Wayfair says that\u2019ll change in the future.\nOnce you\u2019ve uploaded a photo, Decorify prompts you to choose a style: \u201cTraditional,\u201d \u201cModern,\u201d \u201cFarmhouse,\u201d \u201cBohemian,\u201d \u201cRustic,\u201d \u201cIndustrial,\u201d \u201cGlam\u201d or \u201cPerfectly Pink.\u201d Then, the app \u201ctransforms\u201d your room, replacing the fixtures, rugs and furniture in the photo with products in the selected style.\nThe experience brings to mind REimagineHome, an app that similarly taps generative AI to restyle images of spaces. Interior AI is another along those same lines. What Wayfair brings to the table, then, isn\u2019t novel technology necessarily, but the might of its brand and massive online inventory.\nImage Credits: Wayfair\n\u201cCombining the visual discovery and inspiration with shoppable products from an extensive catalog that covers everything home, Decorify has the potential to drive significant value for Wayfair customers,\u201d Sadalgi added. \u201cWayfair hopes Decorify can kick off a camera-first shopping paradigm for visual discovery where the journey simply starts with clicking an image.\u201d\nIn my brief testing, Decorify worked well enough \u2014 style depending. I had the best luck with \u201cRustic\u201d and \u201cModern,\u201d which, true to the app\u2019s sales pitch, replaced my pictured couch, TV, entertainment console, table, chairs, siding and even ceiling with items you might find in Wayfair\u2019s catalog.\nImage Credits: Wayfair\nDecorify isn\u2019t perfect, though. The products in the transformed photos aren\u2019t actually real \u2014 they\u2019re only meant to serve as inspiration. Decorify provides a list of the best matches available on Wayfair, but the suggestions weren\u2019t often that close in my experience.\nAnd, as I alluded to earlier, Decorify struggles to apply some of the styles. \u201cPink\u201d gave my furniture a\u00a0very uneven coat of bright pink, while \u201cGlam\u201d mistook a table for some kind of Victorian-era fainting couch.\nOne of Decorify\u2019s failure cases.\nSadalgi stressed that this is an early version of the tech that\u2019ll improve with time. Currently, Decorify is using Stable Diffusion, the open source diffusion model from Stability AI, as the base model. But Wayfair plans to gradually fine-tune the model on its in-house image data.\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident that we can fine-tune the model using proprietary Wayfair brand data so the results look a lot closer to a lifestyle photo that you see on Wayfair today, with more creative control over the style and one-to-one correlation with real products,\u201d Sadalgi said. \u201cIn the short term, Decorify will support more rooms and improve the shoppability \u2026 We plan to offer swapping out furniture with specific furniture you may have already found on Wayfair, so customers can visualize how a product may look in their space.\u201d\nWe shall see.\nIn any case, Wayfair\u2019s embrace of generative AI comes as other platforms look to apply the tech to e-commerce, where \u2014 like Wayfair \u2014 they hope it\u2019ll drive sales.\nGoogle recently launched a generative AI experience that lets users preview clothes on different models before buying them. Elsewhere, Amazon \u2014 which has experimented previously with virtual try-on tech for products like shoes and jewelry \u2014 is using generative AI to summarize product reviews in its Shopping app.\n",

        "content": "Spotify just reported its second-quarter earnings and the two most impressive metrics are the number of subscribers and the total number of Spotify users. There are currently 220 million people who pay for a Spotify subscription around the world \u2014 that number is up 17% year over year.\nOverall, Spotify now has 551 million monthly active users. That means that 331 million users are currently using the service every month with a free, ad-supported account. Spotify has never added as many users in a single quarter \u2014 36 million new active users.\nIn other words, Spotify is growing nicely, but the company is attracting more free users than paid users. Of course, there is some porosity between these two buckets as some users start with a free account and then become paid subscribers while others stop paying for a premium subscription for one reason or another.\nSpotify\u2019s premium subscribers now represent 39.9% of its overall user base. That ratio has been going down over time (but remember that the total user base is growing). This is an important metric as it is much easier to monetize paid users than ad-supported users.\nWhen it comes to gross margin, Spotify currently generates 28.4% in gross margins for premium users. The gross margin on free users is currently negative, at -5.7%. But the company has made some write-off charges on content assets and contract termination this quarter. Its adjusted ad-supported margin is at +5.7%.\nBut let\u2019s be honest, Spotify\u2019s overall gross margin is not as good as expected. With a gross margin of 24.1%, it\u2019s less than estimates of 25.5%, according to Yahoo Finance.\nThe company reported nearly \u20ac3.2 billion in revenue for the most recent quarter ($3.5 billion at today\u2019s exchange rate). Revenue is up 11% year over year. However, Spotify also reported \u20ac247 million in operating loss ($274 million).\nIf you take into account the company\u2019s recent layoffs and related charges, Spotify claims that it registered \u20ac112 million in adjusted operating losses ($124 million). Unless the company conducts another wave of layoffs, operating losses shouldn\u2019t be as bad next quarter.\nHowever, as losses are much higher than expected, Spotify shares are currently trading down 9.30% in pre-market trading, at $148.50 per share.\nAfter resisting raising its prices for months, Spotify finally announced a price hike for its premium plans yesterday. In the U.S., an individual premium plan will now cost $10.99 per month instead of $9.99. Similarly, the duo plan will cost $14.99 instead of $12.99 and the family plan will be priced at $16.99 instead of $15.99.\nThe company is also reflecting these price hikes in other markets, including much of the European Union, the U.K. and several other countries in South and Central America, Asia and Oceania. These changes should have a great impact on Spotify\u2019s bottom line going forward.\n",

        "title": "African governments are collaborating with innovators to strengthen local health supply chains",
        "content": "Last year, global healthcare consulting firm Salient Advisory surveyed more than 80 companies across four African countries for a report emphasizing the growth of startups digitizing the continent\u2019s health supply chain and distribution and regulatory frameworks governing e-pharmacy activities.\nThis time, the firm went deeper into Africa\u2019s health supply chain segment, broadening the scope of its research and making some tweaks. For one, it searched for startups across 54 countries (compared to four from last year) and included companies with verticalized health supply chain offerings.\nTracking nearly 350 innovators across 27 countries, Salient Advisory\u2019s 2023 report establishes that public health supply chains across the continent are embattled and overburned, leaving most Africans with little choice but to source products from private health innovators. The issue, however, is that private health supply is fragmented from manufacturing to distribution, ultimately impacting price, availability and quality (fake and substandard products are more available in open drug markets in Africa than global standard medicine, for instance.) As such, Salient Advisory\u2019s report, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, looks to track innovators leveraging technology to digitize supply chain processes and solve these problems.\n\u201cOne thing to consider that has happened since the pandemic in Nigeria, and globally to an extent, is several shortages we noticed in supplies like the personal protective equipment (PPE). Those problems existed because of gaps in health supply chains,\u201d Yomi Kazeem, engagement manager at Salient Advisory, said on a call with TechCrunch. \u201cAnd so in light of that, it\u2019s important to take a look at how health startups are using technology to try and improve supply chains on the continent to ensure that individuals in urban areas or in rural communities have better and safer access to health products.\u201d\nSalient Advisory findings also show how African governments (about 11 from the research) are working with health supply chain innovators on nearly 50 partnerships, leveraging their tech-enabled solutions to resolve long-term challenges around the availability, accessibility and quality of health products in public health supply chains. Roughly half of the identified partnerships focus on enabling governments to digitize ordering and inventory management to improve efficiency and minimize wastage, highlighting governments\u2019 strong interest in adopting digital order and inventory management solutions.\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Kazeem dissects Salient\u2019s findings, touching on the importance of innovators working in partnerships with governments, loopholes that need to be filled despite the commendable efforts, disparities in funding across health supply chain innovation ecosystems and an update on the Investing in Innovation (I3) initiative geared toward female-led startups.\nTechCrunch: Salient\u2019s report from last year strictly contained innovators in the private health supply chain segment. But this year\u2019s report includes B2B e-commerce platforms like Copia Global. Why\u2019s that?\nYomi Kazeem: Primarily, the way to think about this is to think about the segments of companies, and the way to categorize them is in what they offer. Despite being an e-commerce company, Copia Global, for instance, was included because over-the-counter medication is one of the products it offers in Kenya, where it operates.\nSince we\u2019re looking to track startups and innovators that use technology to improve access to medicines, large e-commerce operators, not just Copia, but others like Glovo, Jumia and Konga, also feature. Although health products are not the only thing they distribute and are probably one of their smaller verticals, it\u2019s essential to highlight them because these are significant channels and platforms that could be pivotal to ensure greater and broader access.\nWhat other new categories were introduced in this research?\nWhen you\u2019re thinking about supply chains, you have to think broadly. It\u2019s not just about who\u2019s running an online pharmacy allowing individuals to order products. It includes platforms enabling pharmacies, clinics and hospitals to order products directly from a manufacturer or distributor and getting those products delivered to them, providing retailers with financing and credit solutions. It includes those offering solutions around transport, warehousing and reverse logistics because those are also key supply chain processes and that\u2019s where drone delivery operators like Zipline, which works with governments to deliver essential medical supplies to public health facilities, come in.\nThe selection also goes beyond this to include other solutions, like those ensuring product protection and visibility, which solves the massive problem of fake and substandard medicines. You have companies like Chekkit building solutions around that. Another interesting subset that we saw, even though there aren\u2019t a lot of these types of companies out there, are those that are involved in supply chain data analytics, trying to figure out what products are being consumed and also helping government agencies in charge of distributing medicines to better plan their demand and understand consumption trends.\nDoesn\u2019t the funding raised by these larger companies like Zipline and Glovo skew the numbers reported in the research?\nIt does. Large U.S. and Europe e-commerce companies and medical drone delivery operators accounted for about 77% of the money raised by the innovators in our research. Although they skew the data a bit because their operations are not just health, it\u2019s something we were super clear and upfront about in the study.\nAside from the intricacies of introducing new innovators to the research, what other exciting trends are worth highlighting from the report?\nThe more exciting bits lie in core health supply chain startups that are building solutions being adopted by the governments. It\u2019s a huge thing to see in these ecosystems where government agencies or governments, either at national or sub-national levels, are leveraging these solutions to improve public health supply chains. There are several examples of this in Kenya, where Maisha Meds, an inventory management and digital marketplace startup, has partnered with as many as three different county governments in the country, and those county governments are using their inventory management solution in public health facilities.\n\nAfrican health tech startups in the supply chain segment show rapid growth, spurring a $7M investment initiative\n\nIn terms of real-life impact, for example, by using that technology solution, the public health facilities can manage their stock better or minimize waste because they now have a clever sense of what products are available or when the following stock-up is likely to happen. Without such a tool to give them all that information upfront, they might have many expired products in their inventory without being fully aware of it. So that\u2019s just an example of how these solutions solve real problems for governments. Across the service categories, solutions provided by the order and inventory management category are the most adopted by governments across the continent.\nNow, we identified nearly 50 partnerships where governments have or are working with innovators, basically using their solutions to improve the public health and supply chain. This is incredible because one key thing to note is that in the context of health across Africa, if these companies are going to achieve scale, working with large public purchasers is essential to that journey. And so if governments are ordering services from these startups, that\u2019s a pathway to scale. Beyond scale, the benefit to the government or the people is that the benefits of using that technology solution will translate into public health impact.\nThe report states that these partnerships require support. Is this support from the government or a third party? What\u2019s the context behind this?\nSpeaking with government officials and startups, the reality of executing partnerships can be challenging, especially regarding funding. For example, a state government asked a startup to source a particular type of product; the order size was worth about $250,000. The startup couldn\u2019t access the credit finance required to fulfill that order because the government would not pay upfront. And so what ended up happening was that the state government had to reduce the size of that order by up to 80%. And in doing that, it cut off essential products, including surgical supplies and consumables.\nWith that context in mind, our recommendation here is a role for donors and global health agencies to play in designing trade financing solutions and mechanisms and providing that directly to innovators working with large businesses and governments. Those early-stage innovators can access the financing required to fulfill large orders and prove their service\u2019s validity or use case, and can then build the long-term possibility of working together with the government at a level where there\u2019s a better rapport and flow in terms of providing the service and getting paid.\nThe other thing to point out regarding our recommendations for global health actors is also in continuing to understand the role of grants. So, one of the things we uncovered in the research is that if you look at the funding section, equity is the most common source of funding. But when you disaggregate for companies founded by men and women, you realize that equity is not as equally available to women as it is to men. We have a reality where startups founded by women rely heavily on grants and debt compared to those founded by men. To put this in perspective, of all the money that startups founded by men have raised, 96% is equity, 3% grants and 1% debt. For women, it\u2019s 50% equity, 35% grants and 15% debt.\nWe spoke with women founders and stakeholders and included an agenda-focused case study in the report where we explored some of the systemic reasons driving the barriers women founders in health supply chain ecosystems face. A few reasons jumped out, like unequal access to funding, embedded gender bias in selection committees and women-led businesses being perceived as riskier when investing compared to men, even though they\u2019re operating businesses at similar levels.\nFundamentally, grants are still critical in terms of creating more equitable innovation ecosystems because, ultimately, there\u2019s an important role to play for companies that women found.\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons why the $7 million pan-African health tech initiative Investing in Innovation (I3) was launched last year, right? What\u2019s been the progress on that front?\nThe first year just wrapped up and 31 different startups were selected and got grants. We are now rolling into the second year, where another 30 companies across Africa will also get selected. The initiative reinforces our point because when you look at the funding sources for these innovators, the Investing Innovation Program, launched just last year, is at the top of that list. It\u2019s the most common source of funding for health supply chains on the continent because they participated in 31 deals, essentially providing grants.\nAnd then, of course, the other grant programs like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (investing directly) and a few equity folks, also stand out. Plug and Play Ventures and Launch Africa are at the top of the list in terms of sources of equity funding. But it highlights the role that grants play and the program itself is designed to place an emphasis first on African founders but also, of course, pay particular attention to startups that women found. In the first cohort, about 48% of the companies selected were founded by women founders and I believe that that same intentional thinking is in place for this year; perhaps it might be taken to an increased and higher level.\nWhat lessons about early-stage startups and partnerships with the government does the research drive home?\nCompanies that are nascent and early typically focus on serving consumers, but as they grow and achieve more maturity, they have a bit more bandwidth to be flexible. And we see greater diversity in who they serve as they mature, which is why we see many partnerships with government. The I3 program is also striving to introduce startups to governments and, in some cases, to other industry stakeholders, including manufacturers. All of that is important to ensure that the startups can go from where they are early or early at the growth stage to establishing themselves and businesses.\nThe benefit goes both ways, especially working with governments. One thing we\u2019ve often wondered about or looked at is the government\u2019s disposition to innovation. It\u2019s often perceived as adversarial. That\u2019s the thinking. But here, we see governments by themselves seeking solutions and adopting them.\nThe general feedback when we engage with government actors was that there\u2019s a lot of interest in how governments view partnerships. It\u2019s still early days. And so the hope and expectation is that over the coming months and years, we\u2019ll see many more partnerships. One thing that\u2019s important to emphasize, in addition to scaling startups, is the real-life benefit and impact of governments using technology in public health systems to ensure safer access to quality medicines. That translates to better positive health outcomes for individuals and jobs, which is fantastic in this ecosystem.\n",

        "content": "Prosus, one of the largest investors in Byju\u2019s, expressed its disappointment in the edtech giant\u2019s reporting and governance practices on Tuesday, a month after all the key investors quit the startup\u2019s board. Prosus said in a scathing a statement on Tuesday that Byju\u2019s reporting and governance structures \u201cdid not evolve sufficiently for a company of that scale,\u201d and the Indian firm \u201cdisregarded advice and recommendations\u201d from Prosus\u2019 director despite repeated attempts.\nProsus, the largest external investor in the Bengaluru-headquartered startup, said its director, Russell Dreisenstock, stepped down from Byju\u2019s board after it became clear that \u201che was unable to fulfil his fiduciary duty\u201d to serve the long-term interests of the company and its stakeholders.\nThe move follows three key Byju\u2019s investors \u2014 Sequoia India, Prosus and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative \u2014 quitting the startup\u2019s board last month. Byju\u2019s, which at $22 billion valuation is India\u2019s most valuable startup, downplayed the significance at the time,\u00a0saying the directors \u201chad to vacate\u201d the board because their shareholding fell below the minimum threshold set in the shareholding agreement.\nTrouble is mounting at Byju\u2019s. Global auditor Deloitte also quit the startup last month, saying it had not received \u201cany communication\u201d from Byju\u2019s on the status of \u201caudit readiness of the financial statements and the underlying books and records for the year ended March 31 2022.\u201d\nByju\u2019s, which has raised more than $6 billion altogether, has spent over $2.5 billion in recent years to aggressively expand globally in a move that rattled some of its investors, according to people familiar with the matter. As the market conditions shifted, the startup has had to postpone its listing plans, lay off thousands of employees and scramble for other ways to cut costs.\nThe scathing statement from Prosus is remarkable for many reasons. Prosus is one of the earliest backers of Byju\u2019s and has never sold any of its shares in the company. The Netherlands-headquartered investment group, which has also cut the worth of its stake in Byju\u2019s in recent quarters, said today that it has invested billions in India and remains a \u201clong-standing and committed supporter\u201d of Indian entrepreneurship.\n\u201cWhile the companies and sectors we work with in India and across the globe are high-growth and rapidly evolving, our stakeholders rightly expect that we hold ourselves and our investee companies to the highest standards of corporate governance and reporting,\u201d it added in a written statement.\nThe statement adds:\nBYJU\u2019S grew considerably since our first investment in 2018, but, over time, its reporting and governance structures did not evolve sufficiently for a company of that scale. Despite repeated efforts from our Director, executive leadership at BYJU\u2019S regularly disregarded advice and recommendations relating to strategic, operational, legal, and corporate governance matters. The decision for our Director to step down from the BYJU\u2019S Board was taken after it became clear that he was unable to fulfil his fiduciary duty to serve the long-term interests of the Company and its stakeholders.\nBYJU\u2019S sits at the intersection of India and Education, two very important and strategic areas of investment for Prosus. Although we no longer have a representative serving on the Board of the Company, we continue to believe in the potential of BYJU\u2019S and its role in revolutionising access to quality education in India and around the world. As a shareholder, Prosus will continue to assert its rights, collaborating with other shareholders and government authorities to safeguard the long-term interests of the Company and its stakeholders.\nIn a statement, a Byju\u2019s spokesperson said of Prosus\u2019 comment: \u201cWe have noted the observations of our valued investors. We have updated our shareholders about definitive steps taken to improve corporate governance and financial reporting.\u201d\n",

The suit, which is seeking a compensation payout that could be as high as \u00a3800 million (over $1 billion), accuses the tech giant of abusing a dominant position by charging an \u201canticompetitive\u201d 30% fee on in-app sales made by app makers on its iOS App Store. It also argues U.K. consumers are missing out as developers are being deprived of money that could be spent on R&D to drive forward app innovation.\nSean Ennis, a professor of competition policy at the University of East Anglia who has held positions at the OECD, U.S. Department of Justice and European Commission, is bringing the class action on behalf of over 1,500 U.K.-based developers.\n\u201cI have been studying competition questions for decades \u2014 and digital competition for quite a long time. I\u2019ve written about it in technical economic papers but also in less technical work. And I\u2019m really convinced that the type of behaviour we\u2019re talking about in this case is deeply problematic. So I was interested in taking a role to help get some redress for those who I feel have been harmed by the behaviour,\u201d he told TechCrunch, discussing his motivations for filing the suit \u2014 which is being funded by U.K. litigation funder Harbour.\nThe lawsuit is an opt-out class action, which means U.K.-based developers don\u2019t have to register to be included in any potential winnings. If the litigants prevail against Apple, the level of damages due per developer would be calculated based on their iOS app business \u2014 so payouts could range widely and even be millions of pounds in some cases.\nThe core argument the litigants are making is a familiar one. The likes of Spotify and Epic have railed for years against Apple\u2019s unfair \u201ctax,\u201d as they couch it \u2014 filing their own high-profile complaints against its App Store polices and fees with regulators and courts on both sides of the Atlantic, with varying degrees of success. Even Elon Musk has dubbed Apple\u2019s commission on in-app purchases a de facto global tax on the internet.\nApple routinely rejects accusations it\u2019s profiteering at developers\u2019 expenses by arguing the fees it charges enable it to provide iOS users with a premium experience, noting its administration of the store includes reviewing apps for security and privacy concerns, among other quality controls (albeit, scams \u2014 the subject of an earlier App Store related developer lawsuit that Apple settled last year \u2014\u00a0do still slip through).\nNonetheless, plenty of developers continue to press the flip side: Arguing Apple\u2019s fee is unfair \u2014 both in the non-uniform way it\u2019s applied (since some apps/types of content are charged, while others aren\u2019t) and as a result of the size of the cut taken (in 2020 Apple did drop its fee to 15% for the first $1 million in revenue generated but after earning that much developers are still typically moved onto its \u201cstandard\u201d 30% cut).\nThis U.K. suit aims to test the arguments in a bid to get developers compensation for what the litigants argue is abusive, anticompetitive behavior by Apple.\nThe law firm supporting Ennis to bring the suit is Geradin Partners. Discussing the argument they intend to make on developers\u2019 behalf in an interview with TechCrunch, partner Damien Geradin highlighted a couple of elements he suggested will be points of focus for the suit \u2014 firstly pointing to Apple\u2019s fee being non-uniformly applied, with just 16% of apps subject to it as a consequence of how (inconsistently) Apple applies its rule charging the commission on apps that provide digital content, with apps like games, news and streaming services tending to bear the brunt of the charge while other apps slip under the radar.\nHe also flagged the fact that Apple also charges developers an annual ($99) program fee. And suggested developers increasingly need to pay Apple to buy search ads in order to have a chance of their software being discovered by iOS users. Point being, Apple has a variety of routes to monetize the store.\n\u201cAnother element that is critical is that even if the fee was zero, you would still have the same App Store because Apple could not sell a single device without valuable apps such as Tinder, Spotify, Netflix, news apps, game apps and the like,\u201d he also suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s only because they have created a monopoly of distribution for themselves that they\u2019re able to collect this extraordinary commission.\u201d\nThe details (and fairness) of App Store T&Cs are being chewed over by a number of competition regulators, including the U.K.\u2019s own Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) \u2014 which opened its probe back in March 2021.\nIn some markets, including Europe and Asia, we\u2019ve also seen enforcement action by regulators focused on Apple\u2019s App Store payment services terms that\u2019s forced it to let third parties use alternative payment processors, with some (limited) impact on the fees it charges.\nBut it\u2019s fair to say the company hasn\u2019t yet faced a major regulatory reckoning over the 30% charge.\nDamages lawsuits might move the behavioral needle, though. Albeit, it could take years, plural, for cases like this one to deliver a verdict (and any blockbuster payouts for developers).\nBy launching their legal action now, the litigants say they\u2019re hoping their suit can be joined with an existing (consumer damages-focused) App Store suit \u2014 aka Dr. Rachael Kent v. Apple \u2014 which was filed back in 2021, and is seeking \u00a31.5 billion in damages on behalf of U.K. consumers. That suit has been certified and is awaiting trial at the Competition Appeal Tribunal.\nPressed on the timing of their suit, and specifically why they didn\u2019t decide to wait for the CMA\u2019s App Store investigation to run its course before litigating, they suggested they don\u2019t need to wait for competition regulators to provide further proof of harm \u2014 pointing to scrutiny work already undertaken in some jurisdictions (including a major mobile market ecosystem study recently concluded by the CMA).\n\u201cIf you look at the CMA mobile ecosystem market study, released a few months ago, you\u2019ll see exactly the same findings,\u201d argued Geradin. \u201cYou see that the profitability of the App Store is between 75% and 100%. It\u2019s literally an ATM. It\u2019s a money printing machine. And we take issue with that. And so we don\u2019t discuss that they provide a service but not to the tune of 30% commission collected in a discriminatory manner.\u201d\nThe litigants also point to economic analysis they\u2019ve commissioned by Compass Lexecon \u2014 which they suggest shows Apple\u2019s market dominance has given it \u201cextraordinary and excessive profits at the expense of the value provided by app developers,\u201d as they put it.\n\u201cA report to the US House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law states that Apple\u2019s net revenue from the App Store alone was estimated to have been about $15BN in 2020, rising to $18.8BN in 2022. According to the same report, Apple\u2019s former Senior Director of App Store Review confirmed running costs for the App Store were less than USD $100M a year,\u201d they also wrote in a press release announcing their suit today.\nGeradin added that they expect the legal discovery process to deliver any other relevant data needed to bring their claim home for U.K.-based iOS developers.\nIn the CMA\u2019s case against Apple\u2019s App Store, despite well over two years of investigation, the proceeding hasn\u2019t led to any public enforcement yet. Recently there\u2019s been a string of case notifications about extensions to its review and analysis timelines for examining gathered intel. But it remains unclear when the regulator may make a decision. There are no statutory deadlines for such cases \u2014 which means a complex investigation can keep being extended if the CMA deems more time is needed to ensure a robust and thorough review. (Or, well, for any other reason it considers important.)\n\u201cYou never know with competition authorities,\u201d Geradin also remarked, further fleshing out why they\u2019re not waiting around for the CMA to deliver a verdict. \u201cI spent my life waiting for them to take action. So maybe something will happen next week, or maybe something will happen next year. So it\u2019s always a bit delicate to wait for what they will do \u2014 considering you never know when they will take action and what the action will cover.\u201d\nHe also emphasized the suit is seeking compensatory damages on developers\u2019 behalf for what they allege are anti-competitive wrongs Apple has already wrought. Whereas competition authorities focus on correcting abusive behaviors going forward.\n\u201cThey [the CMA] may request Apple to change behaviour but it does nothing for the past. Whereas a damages claim is for the past, and we think that the app developers have been taking advantage of and they should be compensated for past actions. So these are complementary tools,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also, we don\u2019t know what the scope of the CMA investigation is about \u2014 the CMA has been very quiet and sort of discreet about what they\u2019re looking at.\u201d\nIn recent years, a number of U.K. class-action style suits have been brought unsuccessfully against major tech firms seeking damages for breaches of privacy law \u2014 typically foundering over challenges related to establishing a class (e.g., a recent health data claim against Google DeepMind, or the Safari tracking lawsuit against Google). However, privacy suits may not offer much of a steer on how competition class actions might fare.\nAsked about this, the litigants expressed confidence vis-\u00e0-vis establishing commonality \u2014 since \u201call our developers that sell digital content are treated in the same way,\u201d Geradin said.\nThey also suggested proving harm linked to antitrust abuse should be more straightforward than in privacy cases where arguments about harms and impacts may be more subjective.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of commonality to the damage here because we\u2019re talking about a 30% commission,\u201d suggested Ennis. \u201cSo compare that to the harm that you suffer from a privacy violation compared to someone else . . . I\u2019m not going to speculate about the facts of those cases but, here, the commission level is just known and common, and that makes some aspects of forming a class easier.\u201d\n\nUK class action lodged against Meta seeks $3.1B for breach of competition law\n\n",

The expansion will make Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT-like AI chatbot available to a broader set of users, as it was previously available to consumers only within Microsoft products, like the Bing mobile app and Microsoft Edge browser.\nThe company confirmed to TechCrunch that Bing Chat is expanding to other browsers, which hadn\u2019t yet been officially announced.\n\u201cWe are flighting access to Bing Chat in Safari and Chrome to select users as part of our testing on other browsers,\u201d said Microsoft director of communications, Caitlin Roulston, in an emailed statement. \u201cWe are excited to expand access to even more users once our standard testing procedures are complete.\u201d\nAccording to those\u00a0who gained access to the Bing AI chatbot on Windows, they received a pop-up in the Windows 10 or 11 taskbar, offering the opportunity to try the Bing AI in Chrome. Otherwise, users can head to Bing.com from their preferred browser, then click on the \u201cChat\u201d icon to try out the experience. In our own tests, however, we could access Bing Chat in Chrome, but not Safari at this time. That could be because we\u2019re not among the \u201cselect users\u201d who were gaining access during the tests.\nImage Credits: screenshot of Bing.com\nBing Chat\u2019s ChatGPT-like experience is powered by OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model, but some have reported that testing the AI chatbot in other browsers had more limitations than with the original version. For example, the blog WindowsLatest.com, which was the first to spot the expansion, noted that Bing Chat in Chrome supports only five messages per conversation, instead of the 30 available in Microsoft Edge. It was also limiting the character count to 2,000, instead of the 3,000 supported by Edge, the site said.\nMicrosoft declined to confirm these details or share any further information about the differences between the various versions of Bing Chat when we asked for more information. The company also wouldn\u2019t confirm when the expansion to other browsers first began, which platforms were supported, or whether the tests would include users in global markets. That\u2019s for us to discover in the days ahead, apparently.\nIn addition to adding support for Chrome and Safari, Bing Chat appears to be testing a native dark theme, too, but this is also not yet broadly available.\nBing Chat has been working its way into other Microsoft products following its launch earlier this year. In a matter of weeks, the new Bing arrived in the Bing mobile app and Edge browser for iOS, Android, and the desktop, in addition to being integrated with Skype. This month, Microsoft announced Bing Chat would also head into the enterprise with a version of Bing Chat that included business-focused data privacy and governance controls. Alongside that announcement, Microsoft also noted Visual Search, which lets the chatbot respond to questions about uploaded images, was rolling out, too.\n",

        "content": "Plans by Kenya\u2019s Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) to withdraw its second case against African fintech giant Flutterwave have been shot down by the High Court, Kenya\u2019s third highest court.\nIn August last year, the agency had frozen $3 million belonging to Flutterwave, Hupesi Solutions, and Adguru Technology Limited on suspicion of money laundering and fraud. The funds seizure happened two months after the ARA froze another $52.5 million belonging to Flutterwave and six other companies. The ARA filed a suit after each seizure, the first of which was withdrawn formally in March this year.\nRequest for the withdrawal of the second suit was rejected by High Court judge Nixon Sifuna, who, in a ruling seen by TechCrunch, noted that the ARA, being a public-funded body, had failed to give reasons for the withdrawal, including \u201cnegotiations or settlement, or the terms of such negotiations or settlement.\u201d\n\nFlutterwave\u2019s troubles in Kenya yet to end as second case proceeds\n\nThis was despite the agency including an affidavit by its investigator and a trove of documents, including bank statements, as evidence that the millions in the fintech\u2019s bank and mobile money accounts were proceeds from crime and money laundering. The judge sought to know why the agency claimed to no longer have any evidence of the alleged crime.\n\u201cThe bodies entrusted with the duty to fight corruption, economic crime, organized crime and similar vices (including money laundering) should not abdicate their divine duty or become complicit in such vices,\u201d said Judge Sifuna, declining the withdrawal, adding that the proceedings will be determined upon receipt of an affidavit sworn by the agency\u2019s CEO or a high-ranking officer.\nHe said the agency must be guided by public interest and that its decisions or actions have to \u201cbe open and beyond reproach in the public eye.\u201d\nThe ruling is set to further delay its prospects of getting a license to operate in Kenya.\nResponding to the ruling, Flutterwave spokesperson said: \u201cWe are aware of the recent ruling by the Nairobi High court on 20th of July with regards to the Assets Recovery Agency\u2019s (ARA) case brought against Flutterwave last year and the ARA\u2019s subsequent submission for the case to be withdrawn. While the matter remains subjudice, we regretfully cannot comment on the specific details of the ruling or the case, so as not to be in contempt of the Court.\u201d\n\u201cIt is essential, however, to emphasize that our operations have always been and will continue to be conducted in strict compliance with the law. Our commitment to ethical practices and adherence to regulatory requirements is unwavering and we are actively cooperating with all the relevant authorities to ensure an expeditious resolution,\u201d they said.\nIn the two cases, the agency said Flutterwave\u2019s bank accounts were used as conduits for money laundering under the guise of merchant services. It said Flutterwave had failed to provide evidence to validate retail transactions from customers. It added that there was no evidence of settlements to the alleged merchants.\nFlutterwave was founded in 2016 by Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, Olugbenga \u201cGB\u201d Agboola (CEO), and Adeleke Adekoya, to facilitate cross-border payments in Africa. It has since grown to include a remittance service that allows users to send money to recipients to and from the continent \u2014 a Shopify-like e-commerce platform for small businesses called Flutterwave Store, and Tuition, an education payments platform.\nIt raised $350 million last year at a $3 billion valuation, making it one of the most valuable startups in Africa. It has, however, had to deal with a string of controversies, including claims of harassment, funds misappropriation, and mismanagement.\nUpdated at 04:24 Eastern Time on July 26, 2023 to include a comment from Flutterwave\n\nAfrican fintech Flutterwave triples valuation to over $3B after $250M Series D\n\n",

How do you show traction when you haven\u2019t brought a product to market yet, or when your revenue is more of a trickle than a downpour? To answer the question, think about what traction represents to a startup.\nTraction, in a nutshell, is evidence that your company\u2019s chances of success are increasing, while the risk inherent in the business is going the other way. Traction is proof that what you are doing is working.\nI like to think about the process of building a company as staged de-risking.

You have some resources, like your mental capital (training and experience), your social capital (friends, contacts, people you can lean on) and your drive (the desire to run this company in the first place). You may also have a little bit of actual capital, whether this is money raised from the three friends, family and fools or your own savings. You also have an almost infinite amount of risk.

The exec once again claims, without sharing any specific metrics, that the service\u2019s usage is at an \u201call time high,\u201d and hints at what\u2019s to come in terms of new product experiences for the newly rebranded platform.\nThe service formerly known as Twitter has been working to become more than just a social network and more of an \u201ceverything app,\u201d as owner Elon Musk dubbed it.\nAs the Telsa and Space X exec explained in October 2022, telegraphing Twitter\u2019s eventual rebranding, buying Twitter was meant to be \u201can accelerant to creating X, the everything app.\u201d\nHis grand plan has been to create an app that allows creators to monetize their content, then later moves into payments services and even banking, Musk remarked during a Twitter Spaces livestream with advertisers in November. At the time, he even mentioned the possibility of establishing money market accounts on Twitter that would pay a high-interest rate to attract consumers to X.\nThose possible product concepts were again referenced in Yaccarino\u2019s new missive, when she writes, \u201cOur usage is at an all time high and we\u2019ll continue to delight our entire community with new experiences in audio, video, messaging, payments, banking \u2013 creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.\u201d\nTwitter, now X, has already implemented some of Musk\u2019s ideas around videos and creator monetization. In May, the company began allowing subscribers to upload two-hour videos to its service, which advertiser Apple then leveraged when it released the entire first episode of its hit Apple TV+ show \u201cSilo\u201d on the platform. Fired Fox News host Tucker Carlson had been posting lengthy videos to Twitter as well, until ordered to stop by the network.\nIn addition, earlier this month, Twitter began sharing ad revenue with verified creators.\nHowever, all is not well at Twitter X, whose traffic \u2014 at least by third-party measurements \u2014 has been dropping. Data from web analytics firm Similarweb indicated Twitter\u2019s web traffic declined 5% for the first two days its latest rival, Instagram Threads, became generally available, compared with the week prior. Plus, Similarweb said Twitter\u2019s web traffic was down 11% compared with the same days in 2022. Additionally, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince earlier this month tweeted a graph of traffic to the Twitter.com domain that showed \u201cTwitter traffic tanking,\u201d he said.\nYaccarino subtly pushed back at those reports at the time, claiming that Twitter had its largest usage day since February in early July. She did not share any specific metrics or data. At the same time, however, the company was quietly blocking links to Threads.net in Twitter searches, suggesting it was concerned about the new competition.\nToday, Yaccarino repeats her vague claims around X\u2019s high usage in her company-wide memo even as analysts at Forrester are predicting X will either shut down or be acquired within the next 12 months and numerous critics concur that the X rebrand is destined to fail.\nYaccarino\u2019s memo, otherwise, was mostly a lot of cheerleading, applauding X\u2019s team for their work and touting X\u2019s ability to \u201cimpress the world all over again,\u201d as Twitter once did.\nThe full memo, courtesy of CBNC, is below:\nHi team,\nWhat a momentous weekend. As I said yesterday, it\u2019s extremely rare, whether it\u2019s in life or in business, that you have the opportunity to make another big impression. That\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing together, in real time. Take a moment to put it all into perspective.\n17 years ago, Twitter made a lasting imprint on the world. The platform changed the speed at which people accessed information. It created a new dynamic for how people communicated, debated, and responded to things happening in the world. Twitter introduced a new way for people, public figures, and brands to build long lasting relationships. In one way or another, everyone here is a driving force in that change. But equally all our users and partners constantly challenged us to dream bigger, to innovate faster, and to fulfill our great potential.\nWith X we will go even further to transform the global town square \u2014 and impress the world all over again.\nOur company uniquely has the drive to make this possible. Many companies say they want to move fast \u2014 but we enjoy moving at the speed of light, and when we do, that\u2019s X. At our core, we have an inventor mindset \u2014 constantly learning, testing out new approaches, changing to get it right and ultimately succeeding.\nWith X, we serve our entire community of users and customers by working tirelessly to preserve free expression and choice, create limitless interactivity, and create a marketplace that enables the economic success of all its participants.\nThe best news is we\u2019re well underway. Everyone should be proud of the pace of innovation over the last nine months \u2014 from long form content, to creator monetization, and tremendous advancements in brand safety protections. Our usage is at an all time high and we\u2019ll continue to delight our entire community with new experiences in audio, video, messaging, payments, banking \u2013 creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.\nPlease don\u2019t take this moment for granted. You\u2019re writing history, and there\u2019s no limit to our transformation. And everyone, is invited to build X with us.\nElon and I will be working across every team and partner to bring X to the world. That includes keeping our entire community up to date, ensuring that we all have the information we need to move forward.\nNow, let\u2019s go make that next big impression on the world, together.\nLinda\nX me your thoughts, or reach out to Sarah Perez via email (sarahp@techcrunch.com) or Signal (415.234.3994).\u00a0\n",

        "content": "Meta announced today that it\u2019s rolling out Instagram subscriptions to all eligible creators in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain and the United Kingdom over the next few weeks. The expansion comes as Meta first launched Instagram subscriptions in the United States in January 2022.\nInstagram subscriptions allow creators to offer their followers paid access to exclusive posts, Live videos, Stories, reels, highlights and more. Subscribers also receive a special badge that helps them stand out in the comments section and creators\u2019 inboxes.\nTo be eligible for Instagram subscriptions, creators must be at least 18 years old and have more than 10,000 followers. Creators are able to set a monthly price of their choice for the exclusive content. There are eight price points to choose from, starting at $0.99 per to month to as much as $99.99 per month, depending on how much a creator believes their content is worth.\nThe idea behind subscriptions is to give creators the opportunity to earn recurring monthly income based on support from their fans. Meta plans to continue rolling out access to Instagram subscriptions globally in the coming months.\n\u201cWith Instagram subscriptions, you can develop deeper connections with your most engaged followers and grow your recurring monthly income by giving subscribers access to exclusive content and benefits, all within the same platform where you interact with them already,\u201d Meta wrote in a blog post. \u201cWe will continue to invest in tools that help creators earn money and will have more updates to share in the coming months.\u201d\nMeta first launched subscriptions on Facebook back in 2020 before bringing the offering to Instagram. Subscriptions on Facebook are available to Pages in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States.\nInstagram isn\u2019t the only social media platform that gives creators the option to charge fans for exclusive content. Earlier this year, TikTok launched a new feature called \u201cSeries\u201d that allows eligible creators to post content behind a paywall. Series enables eligible creators to post collections of premium content that viewers can purchase access to. One Series can include up to 80 videos, each up to 20 minutes long.\nSimilarly, Twitter offers a subscription feature that lets users purchase access to exclusive tweets from creators. Like Instagram\u2019s and TikTok\u2019s offerings, creators sets the monthly price of their subscriptions.\n\nInstagram is making it easier to create Reels with the app\u2019s templates\n\n",

        "title": "Spyhide stalkerware is spying on tens of thousands of phones",
        "content": "A phone surveillance app called Spyhide is stealthily collecting private phone data from tens of thousands of Android devices around the world, new data shows.\nSpyhide is a widely used stalkerware (or spouseware) app that is planted on a victim\u2019s phone, often by someone with knowledge of their passcode. The app is designed to stay hidden on a victim\u2019s phone\u2019s home screen, making it difficult to detect and remove. Once planted, Spyhide silently and continually uploads the phone\u2019s contacts, messages, photos, call logs and recordings, and granular location in real time.\nDespite their stealth and broad access to a victim\u2019s phone data, stalkerware apps are notoriously buggy and are known to spill, leak or otherwise put victims\u2019 stolen private data at further risk of exposure, underlying the risks that phone surveillance apps pose.\nNow, Spyhide is the latest spyware operation added to that growing list.\nSwitzerland-based hacker maia arson crimew said in a blog post that the spyware maker exposed a portion of its development environment, allowing access to the source code of the web-based dashboard that abusers use to view the stolen phone data of their victims. By exploiting a vulnerability in the dashboard\u2019s shoddy code, crimew gained access to the back-end databases, exposing the inner workings of the secretive spyware operation and its suspected administrators.\nCrimew provided TechCrunch with a copy of Spyhide\u2019s text-only database for verification and analysis.\nYears of stolen phone data\nSpyhide\u2019s database contained detailed records of about 60,000 compromised Android devices, dating back to 2016 up to the date of exfiltration in mid-July. These records included call logs, text messages and precise location history dating back years, as well as information about each file, such as when a photo or video was taken and uploaded, and when calls were recorded and for how long.\nTechCrunch fed close to two million location data points into an offline geospatial and mapping software, allowing us to visualize and understand the spyware\u2019s global reach.\nOur analysis shows Spyhide\u2019s surveillance network spans every continent, with clusters of thousands of victims in Europe and Brazil. The U.S. has more than 3,100 compromised devices, a fraction of the total number worldwide, yet these U.S. victims are still some of the most surveilled victims on the network by the quantity of location data alone. One U.S. device compromised by Spyhide had quietly uploaded more than 100,000 location data points.\nHundreds of thousands of location data points collected by Spyhide stalkerware on a map of the United States. Image Credits: TechCrunch\nSpyhide\u2019s database also contained records on 750,000 users who signed up to Spyhide with the intention of planting the spyware app on a victim\u2019s device.\nAlthough the high number of users suggests an unhealthy appetite for using surveillance apps, most users who signed up did not go on to compromise a phone or pay for the spyware, the records show.\nThat said, while most of the compromised Android devices were controlled by a single user, our analysis showed that more than 4,000 users were in control of more than one compromised device. A smaller number of user accounts were in control of dozens of compromised devices.\nThe data also included 3.29 million text messages containing highly personal information, such as two-factor codes and password reset links; more than 1.2 million call logs containing the phone numbers of the receiver and the length of the call, plus about 312,000 call recording files; more than 925,000 contact lists containing names and phone numbers; and records for 382,000 photos and images. The data also had details on close to 6,000 ambient recordings stealthily recorded from the microphone from the victim\u2019s phone.\nMade in Iran, hosted in Germany\nOn its website, Spyhide makes no reference to who runs the operation or where it was developed. Given the legal and reputational risks associated with selling spyware and facilitating the surveillance of others, it\u2019s not uncommon for spyware administrators to try to keep their identities hidden.\nBut while Spyhide tried to conceal the administrator\u2019s involvement, the source code contained the name of two Iranian developers who profit from the operation. One of the developers, Mostafa M., whose LinkedIn profile says he is currently located in Dubai, previously lived in the same northeastern Iranian city as the other Spyhide developer, Mohammad A., according to registration records associated with Spyhide\u2019s domains.\nThe developers did not respond to several emails requesting comment.\nStalkerware apps like Spyhide, which explicitly advertise and encourage secret spousal surveillance, are banned from Google\u2019s app store. Instead, users have to download the spyware app from Spyhide\u2019s website.\nTechCrunch installed the spyware app on a virtual device and used a network traffic analysis tool to understand what data was flowing in and out of the device. This virtual device meant we could run the app in a protective sandbox without giving it any real data, including our location. The traffic analysis showed that the app was sending our virtual device\u2019s data to a server hosted by German web hosting giant Hetzner.\nWhen reached for comment, Hetzner spokesperson Christian Fitz told TechCrunch that the web host does not allow the hosting of spyware. In the days after the publication of this story, Spyhide\u2019s domain became inaccessible.\nWhat you can do\nAndroid spyware apps are often disguised as a normal-looking Android app or process, so finding these apps can be tricky. Spyhide masquerades as a Google-themed app called \u201cGoogle Settings\u201d featuring a cog icon, or a ringtone app called \u201cT.Ringtone\u201d with a musical note icon. Both apps request permission to access a device\u2019s data, and immediately begin sending private data to its servers.\nYou can check your installed apps through the apps menu in the Settings, even if the app is hidden on the home screen.\nImage Credits: TechCrunch\nWe have a general guide that can help you remove Android spyware, if it\u2019s safe to do so. Remember that switching off spyware will likely alert the person who planted it.\nSwitching on Google Play Protect is a helpful safeguard that protects against malicious Android apps, like spyware. You can enable it from the settings menu in Google Play.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, the National Domestic Violence Hotline (1-800-799-7233) provides 24/7 free, confidential support to victims of domestic abuse and violence. If you are in an emergency situation, call 911. The Coalition Against Stalkerware also has resources if you think your phone has been compromised by spyware. \n",

        "content": "When it comes to retail, it\u2019s Amazon versus the world. That\u2019s been true for a long time and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. Plenty of factors have contributed to the company\u2019s position as a seemingly unstoppable juggernaut. Among them is Amazon\u2019s canny decision to buy and build fulfillment centers around the world. By last count, it operates 305 in the U.S. alone, with an average of 800,000 square feet.\nLocalized warehouses are a big part of the reason the company has been able to set the standard for same- and next-day delivery. It\u2019s now more rule than exception in the industry, and if your company can\u2019t match it, you\u2019re in trouble. Warehouse-as-a-service (WaaS) and 3PL offerings present a way to potentially remain competitive on that front without having to own and operate these sorts of structures. Very few \u2014 if any \u2014 companies have Amazon\u2019s resources on that front.\nSoftBank Group today announced GreenBox Systems LLC, a joint venture with Symbotic that offers a WaaS solution to companies looking to branch out into warehouse but don\u2019t have the money to buy them outright. Nimble announced similar plans to launch its own outsourced automated warehouses back in March.\nSoftBank notes:\nGreenBox will order Symbotic\u2019s systems over a six-year period commencing in fiscal year 2024, to be implemented across its warehouse network in larger-scale deployments than Symbotic\u2019s current installed base systems. Symbotic expects in excess of $500 million in annual recurring software, parts and services revenue from GreenBox once all systems are operational. Symbotic systems typically become fully operational within 24 months of project design approval.\nThe purchase of Symbotic robots will amount to around $7.5 billion over the contract\u2019s life.\n\u201cGreenBox taps into the powerful potential of A.I. and other enabling technologies in supply chains, while also making the benefits of automation accessible to more businesses through an \u2018as-a-service\u2019 offering,\u201d SoftBank\u2019s Vikas J. Parekh said in a release. \u201cIn partnership with Symbotic, GreenBox will equip customers with more intelligent, streamlined, and scalable warehousing solutions while eliminating the burden of major capital expenditures.\u201d\nSoftBank owns 65% of the company to Symbotic\u2019s 35%. The news also arrives as SoftBank announced that it has purchased 17.8 million shares of Symbotic. The Massachusetts-based firm is far from the biggest name in warehouse robotics, but the company has already drummed up some high-profile deals. Last May, Walmart announced that it was deploying Symbotic systems in its centers across the U.S.\nThe company employs a multi-facets approach to warehouse automation, including Kiva-like autonomous mobile robots, coupled with arms that can pick, place and depalletize. With SoftBank\u2019s help, it went public via SPAC in June 2022.\n",

        "title": "Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds review",
        "content": "I have two stock answers whenever someone asks me which earbuds to buy. The first answers the question with another question: Who made your phone? Like flagship smartphones, fully wireless earbuds are pretty good across the board \u2014 and the category managed to get there in record time. Headphones often operate best with other devices from the same manufacturing, due to feature sets and first-party silicon.\nThe second answer is, simply: Sony. The company has an uphill battle in one very important sense: terrible smartphone market share. Outside of its native Japan, the Vaio is largely non-existent. The high end is dominated by a handful of companies like Apple and Samsung, and the company hasn\u2019t done much to distinguish itself. Nor is it a match for the numerous Chinese smartphone bigwigs. It\u2019s a disservice from what have been some truly excellent earbuds.\nI test a lot of headphones from a lot of headphone makers, but for my own day to day use, I keep coming back to Sony. That applies to earbuds and over-ear headphones alike. They sound great, have great balance and are generally comfortable. If you\u2019ve seen me on an airplane or been in a virtual meeting with me over the past few years, you\u2019ve almost certainly seen me in my WH-1000XM5s. If you\u2019ve run into me on the street, I probably had the LinkBuds S in my ears.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nThose specific headphones have won out for me for two different reasons. The WH-1000XM5 sound great. That\u2019s not to say the LinkBuds S don\u2019t sound very good \u2014 not at all. But it\u2019s the comfort level that trumps the competition. It\u2019s not too hard to find a pair of comfortable over-ears. Earbuds, on the other hand, are significantly trickier. I know a lot of people who can\u2019t wear them at all. I\u2019m sympathetic to that. I\u2019ve had comfort issues in the past.\nIt\u2019s fairly subjective, of course, but man, the LinkBuds S feel and fit great. I\u2019ve since been convinced that were Sony to fit the sound architecture of the WF-1000XM4 earbuds into the LinkBuds S body, it could trounce the competition. When word started leaking out about the WF-1000XM5 I got excited. As a music obsessive, testing good headphones is one of my favorite parts of the job, and Sony seems on the cusp of hitting that perfect sweet spot.\nI say with some disappointment that the WF-1000XM5s aren\u2019t my dream headphones \u2014 although Sony has done a great job significantly reducing the size of both the buds and case since the awkwardly shaped WF-1000 back in 2017. The M5s are 25% smaller and 20% lighter than the last gen, according to Sony. Definitely an improvement, though the latest addition to the line just can\u2019t match the LinkBuds S in terms of fit and comfort. For starters, they\u2019re larger and \u2014 as such \u2014 don\u2019t lie flush. They jut out a bit more and don\u2019t anchor as well, making them suitable for walking around outside. If you\u2019re looking for active lifestyle headphones, probably look somewhere else.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nIf you\u2019re looking for the best-sounding pair of earbuds on the market, however, you may have found them. The WF-1000XM5s are fantastic and well balanced. They handle a wide range of different genres with aplomb, from ambient to hip hop. The latter brings a rich bass experience that doesn\u2019t overwhelm the rest of the frequencies on board. You still can\u2019t beat over ears when it comes to a full and immersive headphone experience, but what Sony has done with these buds remains impressive.\nThe company bucked the trend of loading up SoCs with as much functionality as possible. The jump from the V1 to V2 chip drops on-board noise canceling. Instead, it\u2019s opted to build a standalone chip for ANC, called the QN2e. I will confess that I\u2019m not a silicon expert, but Sony says the decision has allowed it to separate focus on controlling the six-mic array for measuring ambient noise. I certainly can\u2019t argue with the results.\nWe\u2019re still a ways off from full ambient noise cancelation, but the on-board is still excellent, masking the flood of sounds one encounters living in the city. As someone with sensory processing issues, I\u2019ll sometimes pop these in my ears without playing music to help focus on the task at hand. A new pair of grills on the buds\u2019 exteriors, meanwhile, do a better job of blocking out wind noise \u2014 the bane of making calls outdoors.\nThe eartips have been updated as well. I\u2019m not fully sold on them from the standpoint of comfort \u2014 again, I really dig the size of the LinkBuds\u2019 silicone tips. These are more foamy than the standard rubbery inserts. It is nice being able to give them a squeeze and letting them expand inside your ear to form a passive noise cancelling seal. Maybe it will grow on me. Time will certainly tell if it\u2019s as durable as the other stuff. At the very least, it doesn\u2019t seem as spongy as older foam tips. That, um, got to be an issue for people planning to sweat in their earbuds.\nImage Credits: Brian Heater\nThe case is 15% smaller than the last gen. Sony\u2019s come a long way on that front. The company\u2019s earliest charging cases were ridiculously massive. The stated battery life remains the same: eight on the buds for a total of 24 hours with the case. I would say we\u2019re at the point that there\u2019s plenty enough battery here to do just about anything you need to.\nI mean, if you\u2019re flying to the other side of the world, you\u2019re going to have to charge them up a few times. Charge time has dropped a bit. The last gen took five minutes of charging for an hour of playback. Sony has drioped that by two minutes, and unlike the LinkBuds S, they\u2019ll charge wirelessly.\nThe surface of the buds is more rounded than last gen. A flat surface is generally better for the touch controls, but it\u2019s not really an issue. There are a bunch of different features that take some getting used to. There\u2019s the standard play/pause with a tap on the right bud, while the left toggles noise canceling and passthrough. Two and three taps on the right advance and back up the track, respectively, while offering programmable quick access functions on the left. The newest addition is a four-tap feature, which raises volume on the right bud and lowers on the left. Once you get to four taps, it\u2019s generally just easier to control the volume on the source device.\nThe buds add spatial audio and headtracking for Android users. If that\u2019s an essential feature and you\u2019re an iOS user, take a look at the AirPods Pro. A clever built-in bone conduction feature, meanwhile detects your voice as you\u2019re speaking, separating it from other human voices its on-board detects for noise canceling.\nThe line has always been a pricier one, and it\u2019s not getting any cheaper. The M4s added a full $50 over their predecessor, and these tack on another $20, bringing them up to $300. That\u2019s $50 more than the AirPods Pro and $100 more than the LinkBuds S. Ultimately, you\u2019ll need to ask yourself what you\u2019re looking for in a pair of buds. If you want the best-sounding buds and don\u2019t mind paying for it, Sony\u2019s got your covered.\n",

        "content": "Security researchers say they have high confidence that North Korean hackers were behind a recent intrusion at enterprise software company JumpCloud because of a mistake the hackers made.\nMandiant, which is assisting one of JumpCloud\u2019s affected customers, attributed the breach to hackers working for North Korea\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, or RGB, a hacking unit that targets cryptocurrency companies and steals passwords from executives and security teams. North Korea has long used crypto thefts to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons program.\nIn a blog post, Mandiant said the hacking unit, which it calls UNC4899 (since it\u2019s a new, unclassified threat group), mistakenly exposed their real-world IP addresses. The North Korean hackers would often use commercial VPN services to mask their IP addresses, but on \u201cmany occasions\u201d the VPNs failed to work or the hackers did not use them when accessing the victim\u2019s network, exposing their access from Pyongyang.\nMandiant said its evidence supports that this was \u201can OPSEC slip up,\u201d referring to operational security \u2014 the way in which hackers try to prevent information about their activity leaking as part of their hacking campaigns. The researchers said they also uncovered additional infrastructure used in this intrusion that was previously used by hacks attributed to North Korea.\n\u201cNorth Korea-nexus threat actors continue to improve their cyber offensive capabilities in order to steal cryptocurrency. Over the past year, we\u2019ve seen them conduct multiple supply chain attacks, poison legitimate software, and develop and deploy custom malware onto MacOS systems,\u201d said Mandiant\u2019s CTO Charles Carmakal. \u201cThey ultimately want to compromise companies with cryptocurrency and they\u2019ve found creative paths to get there. But they also make mistakes that have helped us attribute several intrusions to them.\u201d\nSentinelOne and CrowdStrike also confirmed North Korea was behind the JumpCloud intrusion.\nJumpCloud said in a short post last week that fewer than five of its corporate customers and less than 10 devices were targeted by the North Korean hacking campaign. JumpCloud reset its customer API keys after reporting an intrusion in June. JumpCloud has more than 200,000 enterprise customers, including GoFundMe, ClassPass, and Foursquare.\n\nSpyhide stalkerware is spying on tens of thousands of phones\n\n",

        "content": "Elon Musk is the best thing that could have ever happened to Mark Zuckerberg. As Musk begins to change Twitter\u2019s branding to X, Facebook\u2019s rebrand to Meta doesn\u2019t seem all that bad.\nZuckerberg might be good at lifting weights these days, but he still needs to pull Meta out from a seriously rough few years. After rebranding to Meta in 2021, the company formerly known as Facebook spent $13.7 billion on VR and AR in 2022, though its social VR apps like Horizon Worlds remain incredibly unpopular.\nZuckerberg was once the most reviled man on the internet. We watched as he faced a social media executive\u2019s worst nightmare, testifying before the Senate over Facebook\u2019s blatant failure to protect user data. We laughed at him, not with him, as he shared his love for \u201csmoking meats\u201d and Sweet Baby Ray\u2019s barbecue sauce. We doubted our sense of reality when he took a big swing (and, so far, a big miss) and renamed his company Meta, quadrupling down on the bet that we all want to wear VR headsets all day.\nEnter Zuckerberg\u2019s saving grace: Elon Reeve Musk, FRS. You know what\u2019s even worse than investing $13.7 billion into something no one wants to pay for? Investing $44 billion into something that no one wants to pay for. Now, some people are thirsting after Zuckerberg because he\u2019s gotten pretty buff with all his cage fight training. Everything\u2019s coming up Mark, even Meta\u2019s stock!\nMusk and Zuckerberg have seemed somewhat serious about the possibility of cage fighting each other at the Roman Colosseum (personally, I want this fight to happen, because one TechCrunch manager has jokingly agreed to send me to Italy to cover the match, and I know he wasn\u2019t serious, but hey, isn\u2019t there a little truth to every joke?). But maybe the closest thing we\u2019ll get to that battle is now unfolding before us: which corporate branding sucks more, Meta or X?\nTwitter was a bit liberal with the whole bird thing, and Musk disliked that from the get-go, changing \u201cBirdwatch\u201d to be called \u201cCommunity Notes.\u201d But this all-encompassing\u00a0branding change didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Musk has made so many bad business decisions at Twitter (or are we calling it X now?) that some people have theorized he could just be trying to run it into the ground for fun. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, though. Musk has been obsessed with the letter X for decades now \u2014 his first big company was x.com, the domain he is now trying to redirect to Twitter. That venture would be renamed to PayPal, which makes a lot more sense for a company that helps people make payments on the internet. Musk calls his toddler X, instead of his full name, X \u00c6 A-12, and upon buying Twitter, he declared that he wanted to turn the company into \u201cX, the everything app.\u201d Not to mention that he already has SpaceX (get it? X?), and he just announced another company he is apparently building, which is called xAI.\n\n\nAnd soon we shall bid adieu to the twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 23, 2023\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no limit to this transformation,\u201d tweeted (or X-ed?) CEO Linda Yaccarino. \u201cX will be the platform that can deliver, well\u2026.everything.\u201d\nWe all clowned on Facebook\u2019s name change to Meta, but it at least somewhat makes sense. Meta is a cohort of apps, just one of which is Facebook, but Facebook arguably isn\u2019t any more important than WhatsApp or Instagram\u2026 and don\u2019t forget Musk\u2019s personal kryptonite, Threads. It\u2019s kind of nice to be able to easily distinguish between whether we\u2019re talking about Facebook the platform or Facebook the company, even if Meta is a stupid name, referring to a metaverse that no one wants. After all, Google rebranded to Alphabet, since the company has grown considerably beyond just a search engine. But X is a preemptive rebrand that assumes that Twitter will soon house a family of apps like Meta, yet none of these apps exist yet. And even if Musk does pull off developing payments, texting, gaming or whatever he\u2019s doing, is X really a good name?\n\n\nOur headquarters tonight pic.twitter.com/GO6yY8R7fO\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 24, 2023\n\nWhen using computers, we\u2019ve been conditioned to associate X with the button that you press to close out of something. Not great for user retention, there. Of course, XXX is shorthand for pornography, which I\u2019m not too pressed about, since that\u2019s one arena Musk actually could leverage to make Twitter profitable (advertisers already left anyway!). But that\u2019s not the case for now, and users have already pointed out that videos on Twitter could soon be referred to as \u201cX videos,\u201d which is the name of a porn site. Twitter\u2019s new logo could be ill-fated in any case, though, since it seems to be similar to a Unicode X character, making it difficult to copyright. Twitter doesn\u2019t even seem to have the scalable vector file of its new logo yet, judging by how it looked when projected in massive size on the side of Twitter\u2019s San Francisco HQ.\nSo, the great Musk-Zuck cage fight is finally upon us. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a bit less exciting than an epic duel in the world\u2019s most iconic arena. It\u2019s a battle of bad choices.\n\nTwitter has officially changed its logo to \u2018X\u2019\n\n",

        "title": "As Twitter destroys its brand by renaming itself X, Mastodon user numbers are again soaring",
        "content": "As Twitter ditches its iconic branding in favor of owner Elon Musk\u2019s favorite letter \u201cX,\u201d its open source rival Mastodon is seeing usage numbers soar. According to a new post from Mastodon founder and CEO Eugen Rochko, the number of monthly active users for his Twitter alternative has been steadily climbing over the past couple of months to have now reached 2.1 million \u2014 or, as remarked Rochko, \u201cnot far off from our last peak.\u201d\nPreviously, Mastodon\u2019s monthly active user numbers had peaked at 2.5 million between the months of October and November, which was shortly after Elon Musk officially took ownership of Twitter. Before, Mastodon had been a much smaller network, with approximately 300,000 monthly active users, the founder had said.\nThe fate of Mastodon\u2019s growth seems often to be tied to Twitter\u2019s moves \u2014 or rather, its missteps. After Twitter\u2019s acquisition, for example, there was a bit of a Twitter exodus as longtime users rebelled against the changes that Musk soon enacted on their favorite microblogging site, ranging from widespread layoffs to erratic moves impacting Twitter\u2019s platform, policy and product strategies, which included a mishandled relaunch of Twitter\u2019s subscription, Twitter Blue, which devalued verification by opening it up to anyone with a credit card to pay for it. That decision is still negatively affecting the Twitter experience, as the company recently admitted to having a Verified spammer problem, requiring a change to Twitter DMs.\nWhile some fleeing Twitter users tested out Mastodon following Musk\u2019s takeover, not all stuck with it, and, as a result, Mastodon\u2019s monthly active users dropped from the high of 2.5 million monthly users to 1.7 million as of the beginning of this month. Other people may have drifted over to the different Twitter alternatives that had emerged, including Bluesky, T2, Spill, Post and more. And some may have just dropped Twitter for good or significantly reduced their posting, leading Twitter traffic to decline.\nIt\u2019s not immediately clear if Mastodon is now once again benefiting from Musk\u2019s missteps with Twitter or if it\u2019s being lifted by the renewed interest in ActivityPub, the decentralized social networking protocol that powers the Mastodon network and other apps. Meta\u2019s recently launched Twitter rival known as Instagram Threads has committed to integrating with ActivityPub, which may have raised awareness around Mastodon and decentralized social networking in general.\nThen again, Twitter users could simply be frustrated with Musk\u2019s recent move to enact rate limiting that reduced the number of tweets that could be viewed by users and subscribers \u2014 an incredibly odd product decision that essentially prevents users from viewing content on the platform, now known as X as of today\u2019s rebranding. Musk claimed that Twitter needed to change the rate limits to deal with a significant increase in bots and spam. But while most social networks have some form of rate limiting in place for the same reason, they don\u2019t usually extend those limits to end users, preventing them from actually viewing the site\u2019s content (and, of course, the ads).\nThis, too, could be a factor in Mastodon\u2019s renewed active user growth.\nOr perhaps, it\u2019s a combination of both of these things and more, including the momentum created by the launches of polished third-party Mastodon clients that have made using the social network less complicated and more enjoyable. That includes apps built by former Twitter third-party app makers, like Tapbots\u2019 Mastodon client Ivory, the TweetDeck-inspired Woolly and Mammoth, a Mastodon client from the developer who made the Twitter app Aviary, but is now being led by a new developer following Mozilla\u2019s investment.\nOther Mastodon apps like Ice Cubes and the no-frills client Radiant have also debuted, while Mastodon\u2019s official mobile app received a refresh of its own earlier this month, aimed at addressing various pain points and adding more customization options. At the time of its launch, Mastodon then had 1.4 million monthly active users and Rochko had noted posting activity had tripled over the weekend \u2014 a change likely attributable to Twitter\u2019s new limits on viewable tweets.\nMastodon has been benefiting from interest across other tech companies, too, including WordPress, which acquired a plug-in that lets WordPress blogs feed into Mastodon; Medium, which launched its own Mastodon server; and Flipboard which integrated with the network in its social reading app, launched its own server and is working to integrate with ActivityPub.\n\nTwitter has officially changed its logo to \u2018X\u2019\n\n",

        "content": "Impulse Space, the space logistics startup headed by founding SpaceX employee Tom Mueller, has closed a new tranche of funding to further develop its line of orbital transportation vehicles.\nThe oversubscribed $45 million Series A was led by RTX Ventures, the venture capital arm of RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies), and included participation from existing investors Founders Fund, Lux Capital, Airbus Ventures and Space Capital. Founders Fund led Impulse\u2019s $20 million seed round in early 2022, while Lux Capital previously supported the company with a $10 million funding deal last summer.\nMueller is understood to be one of the preeminent experts in propulsion alive today, and it\u2019s a reputation he earned: as employee No. 1 at SpaceX, he led the development of the Merlin and Draco engines, which power the Falcon 9 rocket and the Dragon spacecraft, respectively.\nThis latest venture, which Mueller founded in 2021, two years after his retirement from SpaceX, is also centered around propulsion. Impulse is developing a series of spacecraft which it calls \u201corbital maneuvering vehicles,\u201d designed for last-mile payload delivery. That includes a vehicle called Mira, and a larger vehicle called Helios. In a statement, Impulse said this latest funding round will be used to further develop Helios, a high-energy kick stage that will be capable of bypassing geostationary transfer orbit and taking payloads directly to geostationary orbit.\nFor the company\u2019s first orbital mission, called Leo Express-1, Mira will perform a series of tasks on-orbit, including last-mile payload delivery, payload hosting, low-altitude maneuvers and atmospheric re-entry. That mission is scheduled to launch on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare mission in the fourth quarter of this year. The primary customer for that mission has not been announced.\nThe Redondo Beach, California-based startup has announced several other missions and partnerships, all of which are considerably more ambitious. The first is an on-orbit refueling demonstration mission with partner Orbit Fab scheduled for 2025. On that mission, Mira will be the hosting platform for Orbit Fab\u2019s fuel depot, and it will rendezvous with a U.S. Space Force satellite to attempt refueling.\nImpulse was also chosen as the propulsion provider for Vast\u2019s private station, Haven-1, which is also scheduled to launch in 2025. If all goes to plan, that will be followed by a mission to Mars (yes, Mars) with Relativity Space in 2026, for which Impulse is developing a Mars Cruise Vehicle and a lander.\n",

        "content": "Remote working and digital nomads became two very prominent aspects of the world of work during the pandemic, shedding light on the millions of people who live in one country but earn money in another. Now, a startup that is building financial services catering to that demographic is announcing some growth funding to expand its business.\nBunq \u2014 a Dutch startup that provides banking, savings, payments, card and other services to consumers with a focus on people who might need such services in more than one country across Europe \u2014 has raised \u20ac100 million in equity funding ($111 million at today\u2019s rates), \u20ac44.5 million that just closed today, and a previously undisclosed \u20ac55.5 million earlier this year.\nThe investment is being made as an \u201cinside round\u201d from previous backers, specifically Pollen Street Capital, Raymond Kasiman and founder and CEO Ali Niknam. The round is coming in a valuation of \u20ac1.65 billion ($1.8 billion today; $1.9 billion in 2021), exactly the same valuation the neobank had in 2021 when it raised $228 million from the same investors.\nThat round was the first and last external investment and thus valuation assessment Bunq had ever taken. Previously the startup was backed by Niknam himself, who invested millions on the back of being a third-time entrepreneur \u2014 he described Bunq to me as \u201cmy third unicorn\u201d in an interview earlier today \u2014 and said that today he still owns about 90% of the company.\nThe plan will be to use the funding to continue expanding Bunq\u2019s business. The company currently has 9 million customers, compared to 5.4 million one year ago, and it has \u20ac4.5 billion in customer deposits (versus \u20ac1 billion two years ago). The majority of its customers are in Europe but Niknam said he sees as big of an opportunity in the U.S. as it has seen in its home territory. In April this year it started the process of getting a banking license sorted there.\nIts aim initially will be to target the various expats from Europe who have moved to the U.S. but still have roots in Europe.\n\u201cI have experienced how complicated things are in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t survive without a bank account, but getting one without a U.S. tax ID [or credit history there] can be mind-bogglingly difficult.\u201d Similarly, he believes that offering services to U.S. residents who have moved abroad to Europe presents another opportunity that\u2019s much easier than opening local bank accounts.\nThe company\u2019s flat valuation, and inside round, speaks to the pressure that we continue to see in the venture market, with those raising larger growth rounds finding it particularly challenging to raise money and to do so at strong valuations.\n\u201cOur first round was at the peak of the market, and so while we have grown considerably, the market has gone down,\u201d Niknam said. \u201cBut we have been perfectly comfortable keeping the valuation that we have now.\u201d \nHe described the company as \u201chealthy and sustainable\u201d: Bunq has been operationally profitable for the last couple of years he said \u2014 based primarily around a model where users pay not big fees for doing transfers and other transactions across borders, but by way of monthly subscription fees for their accounts across a number of tiers \u2014 and the business plan and projections they have is for the whole company to be \u201cprofitable profitable, with money in the bank and everything\u201d by the end of this year.\nHealthy and sustainable are the operative words for Bunq. Founded in the wake of the financial crisis, Niknam saw an opportunity, in 2012, to build a new bank that he said was more \u201cdurable\u201d and built to provide services that consumers really needed. With more trends pointing to people traveling and working across international lines \u2014 \u201cdigital nomads\u201d definitely predated COVID-19 \u2014 and traditional banks not really rising to the challenge to address that in a cost-effective way, it was a signal to him to try to build something that could.\nThe name Bunq does not have a particular meaning as slang, but from what I understand, Niknam liked it because when it\u2019s styled with a lower-case \u201cb\u201d in its logo (bunq), it reads the same way right-side-up as it does upside-down, a metaphor for how the bank aims to be as usable for people regardless of where they are based. And \u201cbunk\u201d sounds a little like \u201cbank.\u201d\nNotably, he said that some 65% of all current accounts at Bunq are primary accounts, meaning that these are the primary deposit accounts for these customers. Having a healthy number of primary accounts as a proportion of activity remains an elusive area for a lot of neobanks, which are not only still accounting for the minority of all current accounts globally, but are often used as \u201csecondary\u201d accounts into which people deposit money after it\u2019s paid into incumbent accounts.\n",

        "content": "Thousands of companies could be at risk from an actively exploited Citrix zero-day that hackers have already abused to target at least one critical infrastructure organization in the United States.\nCitrix last week sounded the alarm about the critical-rated flaw, tracked as CVE-2023-3519 with a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10, which impacts NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway devices. These enterprise-facing products are designed for secure application delivery and providing VPN connectivity, and are used extensively worldwide, particularly within critical infrastructure organizations.\nCitrix warned that the zero-day could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to run arbitrary code on a device and said it has evidence that the vulnerability was exploited in the wild. Citrix released security updates to the vulnerability on July 18 and is urging customers to install the patches as soon as possible.\nDays after Citrix\u2019s warning, U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA revealed that the vulnerability had been exploited against a U.S. critical infrastructure organization in June, and was reported to the agency earlier in July.\nCISA said that hackers exploited the flaw to drop a webshell on the organization\u2019s NetScaler ADC appliance, enabling them to collect and exfiltrate data from the organization\u2019s Active Directory, including information about users, groups, applications and devices on the network. But because the targeted appliance was isolated within the organization\u2019s network, the hackers were unable to move laterally and compromise the domain controller.\nWhile this organization successfully managed to ward off the hackers targeting its systems, thousands of other organizations could be at risk. The Shadowserver Foundation, a nonprofit organization that works to make the internet more secure, said it has found more than 15,000 Citrix servers worldwide at risk of compromise unless patches are applied.\nThe largest number of unpatched servers are based in the U.S. (5,700), followed by Germany (1,500), the U.K. (1,000) and Australia (582), according to their analysis.\nIt\u2019s not yet known who is behind the exploitation of this vulnerability, but Citrix vulnerabilities have been known to be exploited by both financially motivated cybercriminals and state-sponsored threat actors, including groups linked to China.\nIn a blog post published over the weekend, researchers at Mandiant said that while they cannot yet attribute the intrusions to any known threat group, the activity is \u201cconsistent with previous operations by China-nexus actors based on known capabilities and actions against Citrix ADC\u2019s in 2022.\u201d Mandiant added that the intrusions are likely part of an intelligence-gathering campaign, noting that espionage-motivated threat actors continue to target technologies that do not support endpoint detection and response solutions, such as firewalls, IoT devices, hypervisors and VPNs.\n\u201cMandiant has investigated dozens of intrusions at defense industrial base (DIB), government, technology, and telecommunications organizations over the years where suspected China-nexus groups have exploited zero-day vulnerabilities and deployed custom malware to steal user credentials and maintain long-term access to the victim environments,\u201d the researchers said.\n\nNSA says Chinese hackers are exploiting a zero-day bug in popular networking gear\n\n",

It\u2019s now adding text posts, likely to take on Twitter (now X) and Meta\u2019s Threads, as users look for a new place to post text-based content.\nTikTok says the new content option will allow creators to share their stories, poems, lyrics and other written content on the platform, giving them another way to express themselves.\nNow when you open the app\u2019s Camera page, you will be able to choose from three options: photo, video and text. Once you select the text option, you will be taken to the text creation page, where you can type out the content of your post. Then, you can customize your context by adding sounds, tagging a location, enabling comments and allowing Duets. TikTok says text posts will be just as interactive and dynamic as any video or photo post.\nYou can add stickers to your text post, along with tags and hashtags. There\u2019s also the option to choose from a variety of background colors. Similar to video or photo posts, you can save your drafts and store them with other unpublished posts for later editing or discard them entirely.\n\u201cAt TikTok, we\u2019re always looking to empower our creators and community with innovative tools that inspire self expression,\u201d TikTok wrote in a blog post. \u201cToday we\u2019re thrilled to announce the expansion of text posts on TikTok, a new format for creating text-based content that broadens options for creators to share their ideas and express their creativity. With text posts, we\u2019re expanding the boundaries of content creation for everyone on TikTok, giving the written creativity we\u2019ve seen in comments, captions, and videos a dedicated space to shine.\u201d\nAlthough some people were unsure about TikTok\u2019s decision to start supporting images last year, it\u2019s now seen as an integral part of the app. It\u2019s possible that we may see the same happen with text posts, especially since some users already post text-based content on TikTok in the form of a video or image. TikTok\u2019s new feature simply makes it easier and more intuitive to add text-based content to the platform.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that TikTok has decided to add support for text posts now, especially at a time when Twitter is continuing to make questionable decisions and putting limits on non-paying users. TikTok is likely looking to provide an alternative option for users who want to post text-based content. Meta did something similar with the launch of its Threads app earlier this month, which is continuing to grow its user base and traction in global markets. Of course, text posts on TikTok look different than they do on Twitter or Threads, so people might not use text posts on TikTok like they do on other platforms.\nTikTok has dominated the short-video market, and is now once again looking to expand beyond the content format that made it famous in a bid to give users more ways to express themselves, while also taking on other popular social platforms.\n",

        "content": "For many American car owners, on-street parking is their only option. When it comes time to buy an electric vehicle, \u201cWhere do I charge?\u201d will undoubtedly be one of the first questions they ask.\nFast charging is an option, one that most closely mimics the way people fill up at gas stations. But fast chargers are expensive pretty much any way you look at them. They\u2019re costly to manufacture, install and maintain. Because of that, and because such surges in demand can strain the grid, prices for fast charging are significantly higher than slower methods. Plus, even the fastest still takes longer than filling up a gas tank.\nFortunately, cities have an easy way to retrofit their infrastructure to accommodate EVs: the lampposts that support streetlights. Every street has them, and thanks to new energy-efficient LEDs, some even have electric capacity to spare.\nCities around the world have begun to experiment with lamppost charging. London already has about 7,000 run by Ubitricity, a German startup that was bought by Shell two years ago. Drivers bring their own plugs and jack into the outlet at the base of the post. Flo, a Quebec startup, is trialing several dozen with integrated plugs in Los Angeles.\nNow, Voltpost, a New York City\u2013based startup, is throwing its hat into the ring. The company closed a $3.6 million seed round led by RWE Energy Transition Investments with participation from Twynam Funds Management, Exelon Foundation, Good News Ventures and Climate Capital, TechCrunch+ has exclusively learned.\nVoltpost is hoping that it has a few things that\u2019ll give it an edge in a busy but not yet crowded market.

        "content": "Supply Change Capital closed on $40 million in capital commitments for its first fund, targeting investments in the global food industry valued at $10 trillion.\nThe female and Latina-owned firm is spearheaded by co-founders and managing partners Noramay Cadena and Shayna Harris, who met 14 years ago in business school.\nSupply Change Capital\u2019s new fund puts it among a growing group of women-led venture capital firms that closed on sizable debut funds this year. This includes recent announcements by:\n\nJessica Verrilli and April Underwood at Adverb Ventures, who raised $75 million for their debut fund, also announced in July.\nJennifer Stojkovic at Joyful Ventures, which raised $23 million, also for investment in food tech.\nZoey Dash McKenzie at Public Ventures, which is targeting $100 million.\nErin and Sara Foster at Oversubscribed Ventures, which is going after $20 million.\nMeena Harris and Helen Min at Phenomenal Ventures, which debuted with $6 million.\nBe\u0301ne\u0301dicte de Raphe\u0301lis Soissan at Emblem, which raised nearly $54 million.\n\n\nWomen are leaving VC firms and creating a new class of emerging investors\n\nPrior to becoming an investor, Cadena\u2019s background was as an aerospace engineer. When she did pivot to VC, she mainly invested in manufacturing and supply chain companies. Meanwhile, Harris came from the operator side, holding positions as chief operating officer of Farmer\u2019s Fridge and previously developing the sustainable commodities program at Mars.\nThey started raising for the fund in 2021, and it took them about two years to close the $40 million, which they attribute to some factors that included that limited partners wanted to see how they invested as a team and that they are investing in both technology and consumer companies, 75% and 25%, respectively. However, Cadena and Harris say that by having investments in both areas, they can better understand the pain points they hear from their portfolio companies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been interesting how it\u2019s played out in our fund because we don\u2019t think we can be viable and real food tech investors without investing in food,\u201d Cadena told TechCrunch. \u201cThat gives us this halo effect to really understand what emerging brands are facing in the ecosystem. That was another hurdle for us to get through \u2014 where we have to be very steadfast about the fact that it\u2019s actually important for us to understand both sides of the table.\u201d\nThe pair are backed by a list of heavy-hitting limited partners, including 301 INC, the venture capital arm of General Mills; MassMutual through its First Fund Initiative; the Office of the Illinois Treasurer through the Illinois Growth and Innovation Fund; Illumen Capital\u2019s Catalyst Fund; and J.P. Morgan Asset Management.\nStarting in June 2021, Cadena and Harris began investing. In addition, they offer a six-month cohort program that all founders take part in that focuses on leadership, management and culture.\nThey invest at the earliest stages in the areas of deep tech food, agriculture and ingredient, supply chain technology and enterprise software, with a thesis around securing the future food supply.\nSo far, Supply Change has deployed some $13 million already across 15 startups. Eighty percent of the firm\u2019s portfolio is comprised of Latinx, Black or female founders and CEOs.\nThose include allergen-free snack food company Partake Foods, ingredients startup Michroma and alternative seafood maker Aqua Cultured Foods. Among the 15, Supply Change led three of the deals.\nCadena and Harris not only invest in culture and climate, but also the demand side, which is driving the world\u2019s food and water crises.\n\u201cThe demand side is where we really felt like we have a unique lens to bring to this market,\u201d Harris said in an interview. \u201cWhere we see opportunity, and where we see consumers are underserved, is delivering the next food over the next couple of generations. They are focused on those changes, and the need is both in terms of the technologies available to help get them the products they\u2019re looking for, and the actual products getting on the shelf.\u201d\n\nFor female VCs, bias is a branding issue\n\n",

        "title": "A beginner\u2019s guide to Mastodon, the open source Twitter alternative",
        "content": "As Twitter users fret over the direction that new owner Elon Musk is taking the company, masses of users have hopped over to Mastodon, an open-source Twitter alternative. The news that Twitter is rebranding to \u2018X\u2019, a change already live on the website, spurred a surge in usage numbers for the open-source rival.\nSince October 27, when the SpaceX and Tesla CEO formalized his Twitter takeover, Mastodon has gained 2.1M monthly active users. But what is Mastodon, and should we all be getting our accounts set up?\nIf you\u2019re a Twitter purist who likes to use basic functionality like private DMing, quote-tweeting and user-friendly onboarding, Mastodon might not be for you. But if you\u2019re looking to try something new on the social internet, then why not give Mastodon a whirl? Elon Musk isn\u2019t there!\nWhat is Mastodon?\nMastodon was founded in 2016 by German software developer Eugen Rochko. Unlike Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or any other popular social media site, Mastodon is a nonprofit, meaning that, ideally, its goal is to benefit the public, rather than shareholders.\n\u201cUnlike the past 5 years that I\u2019ve been running Mastodon operations as a sole proprietor, where Mastodon\u2019s income was my personal income (minus all the expenses), I am now an employee with a fixed wage,\u201d Rochko wrote in a blog post last year. \u201cMy personal income will thus be lower but I was willing to go this route because I want Mastodon to have more resources for things like hiring extra developers, UX designers, developing official apps and so on, and I want there to be a clear boundary between fundraising for that cause and my personal income.\u201d\nMastodon might look like a Twitter clone at first glance, but the underlying system behind the microblogging platform is far more complex. The service is decentralized (no, not in a blockchain way), describing itself as a \u201cfederated network which operates in a similar way to email.\u201d\nWhen you first create your account, you choose a server \u2014 similar to how you choose to open an email account on Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or wherever \u2014 which generates your profile\u2019s address. So, for example, if you sign up for Mastodon via the climate justice server, then your address will be @[your username]@climatejustice.social. But no matter which server you sign up with, you will be able to communicate with users from any other server, just like how Gmail users email Hotmail users and vice versa. However, some servers might have blocked other servers (perhaps if it\u2019s an unsavory group), which would mean you can\u2019t communicate with anyone from the blocked server.\nThe Mastodon lingo\nMastodon users generally refer to individual communities as \u201cinstances\u201d or servers. These Mastodon servers can be run by individuals, groups or organizations that each have their own set of rules regarding how users can sign up, as well as their own moderation policies. Some servers let anyone join, while others are invite-only or require approval by an admin. For example, a server for professional scientists asks applicants to include a link to their research to demonstrate that they are, indeed, professionals.\nChoosing which server to register your account with might seem stressful, but it\u2019s possible to move your account later, so don\u2019t worry. Plus, you can follow people regardless of which server they\u2019re on.\nYou may also hear Mastodon described as part of the \u201cFediverse,\u201d or an interconnected web of various social media services. You know how having a Twitter account doesn\u2019t mean you can use that account on Instagram? Through the Fediverse, your single Mastodon account also grants you access to other decentralized social networks, if that interests you.\nYou may also see Mastodon\u2019s equivalent of tweets being referred to as \u201ctoots,\u201d but this is fading out of favor (since it\u2019s kind of silly!). Many people are just calling them \u201cposts\u201d these days, but \u201ctoot\u201d is often found referenced in older third-party clients.\nMastodon supports a number of Twitter conventions like replies, retweets, favorites, bookmarks and hashtags. But its retweets are called \u201cboosts\u201d and it doesn\u2019t support the concept of quote tweets. This was an intentional choice on the part of the founder who said it encourages speaking \u201cat your audience\u201d instead of \u201cwith the person you\u2019re talking to.\u201d\n In addition, Mastodon lists work slightly differently from Twitter as you can only add people to a list if you\u2019re already following them. And Direct messages on Mastodon are just @username posts, not private messages coming to a DM inbox.\u00a0\nImage Credits: Fediverse (opens in a new window)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean that Mastodon is open source?\nAnyone can download, modify and install Mastodon on their own server \u2014 plus, the developers of the platform don\u2019t own the copyright.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that you can grab Mastodon\u2019s code without acknowledging the source, though. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s social media platform, Truth Social, initially launched with Mastodon code and passed it off as if it were original software. Mastodon did not take kindly to that.\nHow do you create a Mastodon account?\nWhen you arrive on the Mastodon website, you can click a button called \u201ccreate account,\u201d which directs you to a page listing servers to choose from. You can filter these by various factors, like region, language, topic, sign-up speed and more. There, find a server that piques your interest and join \u2014 if it\u2019s a server that requires you to be approved, you might need to wait a bit. From there, you can start finding people to follow, regardless of whether they\u2019re registered via your same server.\nIn effort to minimize confusion on new users picking a server, Mastodon announced it is making it easier to create an account. Now, when you go to sign up, it will give an easy option to create an account on mastodon.social instead of choosing a server.\nHow do you decide which Mastodon server to join?\nMastodon\u2019s website has helpful resources \u2014 but it\u2019s still a bit overwhelming and challenging to find a home base that aligns with your interests. Ask friends who are already on Mastodon if they have suggestions! Or just join somewhere random, because you can always change your server affiliation later once you get into the swing of things.\nCan you talk to people on other Mastodon servers besides your own?\nYes, you can follow people outside of your local server and reply to their posts. However, when you want to follow someone on a different server, you have to enter their username in the search box on your server to find them first, then follow them. You can\u2019t just go to their profile and click the follow button as you would on Twitter.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the Home, Local and Federated timelines?\nYour Home timeline shows you posts from people that you follow, similar to Twitter. The Local timeline shows posts from all users in your server, while the Federated timeline shows you all public posts from users that people in your server follow. (Hint: You can turn on \u201cSlow Mode\u201d in Preferences \u2013> Appearance to hide timeline updates behind a click if things are coming at you too fast!)\nWhat is Mastodon\u2019s moderation policy?\nIndividual server admins set their own moderation policies, so you should read the policy on the server you choose to ensure it matches up with your values.\nWhat are the drawbacks of Mastodon when compared with Twitter?\nMastodon\u2019s user base is a fraction of a percentage of the size of Twitter\u2019s user base. It\u2019s also far less intuitive to navigate, since it hasn\u2019t been designed for a massive global audience like Twitter. That could change in time as more developers join the project in the wake of the Twitter takeover.\nWhat are the benefits of Mastodon compared with Twitter?\nWell, for one thing, Mastodon is not owned by Elon Musk. But in all seriousness, it\u2019s going to be difficult in the near-term for Mastodon to replicate the same \u201cwatercooler of the world\u201d vibe that Twitter is defined by. Some users might prefer Mastodon to Twitter, though, as it\u2019s more customizable by nature. Unlike Twitter, individual communities have different content guidelines, which provide a variety of different user experiences. And while the user base on Mastodon is smaller, this can lead to more personal and direct conversations, at times, compared with tweeting into the void, so to speak.\nIs Mastodon safer than Twitter?\nMastodon is what you make of it. Due to its decentralized nature, if you are looking for a more controlled online experience, you can join a server with stricter guardrails against harassment. Some Mastodon features are also built with mitigating harassment in mind. For example, you can only search by hashtag, not by words that appear in a toot. So if you want your post to be discoverable, you can tag it \u2014 if you\u2019d rather limit the audience, no one can find your tweet about the Red Sox by simply searching \u201cred sox\u201d if you haven\u2019t tagged it.\nHowever, a text-based search can surface the posts you\u2019ve written, favorited, boosted or have been mentioned in, which can be useful.\nThe service has another handy feature that allows users to easily add a content warning to a post directly in the compose box. Some Mastodon users have been having fun with this lately by \u201cwarning\u201d others their post would be about Twitter drama.\nCan I post images and video?\nAs noted above, Mastodon supports many Twitter conventions, but its support for media is more limited. Where Twitter supports a variety of media and other data appended to tweets, including its audio-only social \u201cSpaces,\u201d plus photos, video, GIFs, polls, precise location and experimental \u201cStatus\u201d tags, Mastodon simply supports images, videos, audio and polls.\nYou can add up to four images to a post, up to eight megabytes in size. Video and audio can be any length, but with a file size limit of 40 megabytes.\nCan I post privately to friends?\nSimilar to how Twitter now allows users to limit their tweets\u2019 visibility through its Circle feature, Mastodon offers the ability to set your post\u2019s privacy at the time of writing. Posts can be set to be public to be visible by all; unlisted to make them public but opted out of discovery features; only visible to your followers; or only visible to those users you\u2019ve mentioned.\nCan I post threads?\nYep! But this functionality isn\u2019t built into Mastodon officially, as it now is on Twitter. Instead, you have to build threads the old-fashioned way \u2014 by replying to your own posts.\nCan I get verified on Mastodon?\nNo. There\u2019s no universal verification system like on Twitter. Some servers may vet their user sign-ups and you can self-verify, in a way, by adding links to your Mastodon profile that have a specific attribute (rel=\u201dme\u201d) in order to prove you are who you say you are.\nSome servers are having fun with the idea of verification in a less-than-official fashion. For example, the mstdn.social server lets you add blue-and-white checkmarks and other emoji to your display name if you\u2019d like, which make you look verified, even though these don\u2019t mean anything. (Sort of like Twitter\u2019s new verification system! But for free!)\nImage Credits: @stux@mstdn.social (opens in a new window)\nIs Mastodon here to stay?\nMastodon is experiencing a massive influx of new users from Twitter, but it\u2019s not clear the platform will continue growing at such a rapid rate in the weeks ahead. With now just one million users, Mastodon is far smaller than Twitter, which today counts over 237 million monetizable daily active users. Still, not all social networks are created equal, and you might find that you prefer tooting about TTRPGs in a dedicated server, as opposed to tweeting into a realm of madness. Or, you might find that this decentralized system is confusing, and you\u2019ll just ride out the Muskening on Twitter. Choose your own adventure!\nI\u2019m not sure I want to leave Twitter. Can I cross-post from Twitter to Mastodon?\nYes, this is possible by way of third-party tools. These require you to authorize your account with Twitter and Mastodon and set up parameters. We\u2019ve had success with Moa Party, which allows you to get specific as to which tweets or retweets are cross-posted. But other tools are available, including Mastodon Twitter Crossposter, which is also available here on GitHub.\nCan I find my Twitter friends on Mastodon?\nYes, this is also possible with third-party tools. We\u2019ve seen many Mastodon users trying out tools like Fedifinder, Twitodon and Debirdify, for example.\nWill Mastodon work with Bluesky, the decentralized social network that Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is building?\nNope \u2014 not unless Bluesky chooses to adopt the ActivityPub protocol Mastodon uses. Currently, Bluesky is not planning to integrate with ActivityPub, having decided to build its own networking protocol, Bluesky, which will also be the name of the social networking app. There is some skepticism among the developer and open source community about whether or not Bluesky\u2019s decision to go its own way is really about its own protocol\u2019s advantages or if it\u2019s more about producing a spec it could eventually control.\n\n\nThere are many existing protocols for decentralizing discourse, including ActivityPub, SSB, Matrix, & RSS. Each of these are successful in their own right, but none of them fully met the goals we had for a network that enables global long-term public conversations at scale.\n\u2014 bluesky (@bluesky) April 6, 2022\n\n\nBoosted by Twitter drama, Mastodon reaches 1 million active monthly users\n\n\nMastodon\u2019s microblogging app saw a record number of downloads after Musk\u2019s Twitter takeover\n\n",

        "content": "Is the grass greener on the other side? We\u2019re not sure, but the sky is most certainly bluer. It\u2019s been over a year since Elon Musk announced his bid to buy Twitter, and those who opposed the sale have tried setting up shop on platforms like Mastodon, Substack Notes, T2\u2026 but none of these Twitter alternatives have really captured lightning in a bottle like Bluesky.\nBluesky remains invite-only in its beta, but as more people get on the site, the hype around it is growing \u2014 though as we know from apps like Clubhouse, the hype might not last forever. In the meantime, Bluesky now has over a million installs, according to estimates from data.ai. The new app sees about 8,300 first-tiime installs per day, on average. So many people are trying to get an invite that they\u2019ve started popping up for sale on eBay (we would advise against making that purchase).\nHere we answer the most common questions about Bluesky social:\nWhat is Bluesky?\nBluesky is a decentralized social app conceptualized by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and developed in parallel with Twitter. The social network has a Twitter-like user interface with algorithmic choice, a federated design and community-specific moderation.\nBluesky is using an open source framework built in-house, the AT Protocol, meaning people outside of the company have transparency into how it is built and what is being developed.\nDorsey introduced the Bluesky project back in 2019 while he was still Twitter CEO. At the time, he said Twitter would be funding a \u201csmall independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers,\u201d charged with building a decentralized standard for social media, with the original goal that Twitter would adopt this standard itself. But that was before Elon Musk bought the platform, so as of late 2022, Bluesky is completely divorced from Twitter. Dorsey has even used Bluesky to express his dismay with Musk\u2019s leadership.\n\nTwitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard. \ud83e\uddf5\n\u2014 jack (@jack) December 11, 2019\n\nHow do you use Bluesky?\nOnce invited, users create a handle which is then represented as @username.bsky.social as well as a display name that appears more prominent in bold text. If you\u2019re so inclined, you can turn a domain name that you own into your username \u2014 so, for example, TechCrunch\u2019s Darrell Etherington is known on Bluesky as @etherington.com.\nThe app itself functions much like a bare-bones Twitter, where you can click a plus button to create a post of 256 characters, which can also include photos. Posts themselves can be replied to, retweeted, liked and, from a three-dot menu, reported, shared via the iOS Share Sheet to other apps, or copied as text.\nYou can search for and follow other individuals, then view their updates in your \u201cHome\u201d timeline. There\u2019s also a \u201cWhat\u2019s Hot\u201d timeline, which surfaces engaging posts. User profiles contain the same sort of features you\u2019d expect: a profile pic, background, bio, metrics and how many people they\u2019re following. Profile feeds are divided into two sections, like Twitter: posts and posts & replies.\nThere is also a \u201cDiscover\u201d tab in the bottom center of the app\u2019s navigation, which offers more \u201cwho to follow\u201d suggestions and a running feed of recently posted Bluesky updates.\nImage Credits: Natalie Christman\nHow do I get invited to Bluesky?\nNew users receive one invite code every two weeks that they\u2019re on the Bluesky app. The company monitors the social graph, giving users that are inviting trustworthy participants more invite codes to share.\nLong-term, Bluesky says it views the invite code system as a piece of the open source tool it\u2019s building to help server admins to curate and moderate their communities.\nWho\u2019s on Bluesky?\nBy beginning of July 2023, when Instagram\u2019s Threads launched, Bluesky topped a million downloads across iOS and Android. Notable figures and organizations, from Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to Twitter exile NPR, have found a new home on Bluesky.\nImage Credits: Data.ai\nDoes Bluesky work just like Twitter?\nIn many ways, yes. However, Bluesky does not yet have DMs or some advanced tools like adding accounts to lists. Additionally, Twitter does not use a decentralized protocol like ActivityPub or AT.\nBluesky was initially kicked off as a project convened by Jack Dorsey in 2019 when he was CEO of Twitter. But the social app has been an independent company since its inception in 2021.\nIs Bluesky free?\nYes, but it is currently invite-only access.\nHow does Bluesky make money?\nBluesky\u2019s goal is to find another means to sustain its network outside of advertising with paid services, so it can remain free to end users. On July 5, Bluesky announced additional seed round funding and a paid service that provides custom domains for end users who want to have a unique domain as their handle on the service.\nIs Bluesky decentralized?\nYes. Bluesky\u2019s team is developing the decentralized AT Protocol, which Bluesky was built atop. In its beta phase, users can only join the bsky.social network, but Bluesky plans to be federated, meaning that endless individually operated communities can exist within the open source network. So, if a developer outside of Bluesky built their own new social app using the AT Protocol, Bluesky users could jump over to the new app and port over their existing followers, handle and data.\nIs Bluesky customizable?\nYes. In May Bluesky released custom algorithms, or what it calls \u201ccustom feeds.\u201d Custom feeds allow users to subscribe to multiple different algorithms that showcase different kinds of posts a user may want to see. You can pin custom feeds that will show up at the top of your timeline as different tabs to pick from. The feeds you pin, or save, is located under \u201cMy Feeds\u201d menu in the app\u2019s sidebar.\nIs Bluesky on iOS and Android?\nYes. Bluesky rolled out to Android users on April 20 and was initially launched to iOS users in late February. The platform technically doesn\u2019t have a web app yet, but if you\u2019re logged in and go to staging.bsky.app, a whole new world will open up for you.\nAre Bluesky posts really called \u2018skeets?\u2019\nThere is technically no name for posts, but internet users have adopted the name \u201cskeets,\u201d a portmanteau of \u201ctweet\u201d and \u201csky.\u201d Users still widely refer to posts as \u201cskeets,\u201d despite protests from Bluesky CEO Jay Graber and others who don\u2019t find the slang for semen amusing.\nWhy are people posting about the \u2018hellthread\u2019?\nAlas, the hellthread. You had to be there. Basically, too many people responded to one thread, all the people in the thread\u2019s notifications broke, the post became impossible to mute, the thread split off into a bunch of different sub-threads\u2026 It was chaos, and the developer who could fix it was off work until Monday \u2014 since it was the weekend \u2014 and he rightfully stood his ground and took his days off, especially since he had just been working tirelessly to get the block feature working. Oh, the joy of small startup teams! But this meant that the hellthread proliferated for the entire weekend. As prominent shitposter June wrote, \u201cso far in day 3 of the hell thread i\u2019ve seen nudes, a game of tic tac toe, love being found, what can\u2019t the hellthread do.\u201d\nIf you reply to the hellthread, you get trapped in the hellthread \u2014 that is, you start getting all the notifications, but you can\u2019t scroll up that far to see the whole hellthread, which makes it sort of confusing, and also, how do you know if you\u2019re in the main hellthread or a sub-thread? It\u2019s easier to conceptualize the hellthread if you imagine it more like a helltree, with roots and branches of varying sizes and strength.\nTo paraphrase Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, every bug that exists long enough becomes a feature.\nOh, also, there was a duck bot that kept replying to the hellthread by saying \u201c\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\udc25 No \ud83d\udcb8, no qwack\u2026\u201d\nWhat\u2019s the difference between Bluesky and Mastodon?\nThough Bluesky\u2019s architecture is similar to Mastodon\u2019s, many users have found Bluesky to be more intuitive, while Mastodon can come off as inaccessible: Choosing what instance to join feels like an impossible task on Mastodon, and longtime users are very defensive about their established posting norms, which can make joining the conversation intimidating. To remain competitive, Mastodon recently simplified its sign-up flow, making mastodon.social the default server for new users.\nWho owns Bluesky?\nThough Jack Dorsey funded Bluesky and sits on the company\u2019s board, he is not involved in day-to-day development. The CEO of Bluesky is Jay Graber, who previously worked as a software engineer for the cryptocurrency Zcash, then founded an event-planning site called Happening.\nIf you have more FAQs about Bluesky not covered here, leave us a comment below.\u00a0\n",

        "content": "Spotify has announced that it\u2019s raising its premium plan prices, confirming reports that first started to surface over the weekend.\nThe music-streaming giant, which claims some 500 million users globally, 40% of which are premium subscribers, revealed that its main premium ad-free subscription plan will be increasing from $9.99 per month to $10.99 in the U.S., while its Duo plan is rising by $2 to $14.99. The family plan, meanwhile, is increasing by $1 to $16.99 and the student plan is also going up by a dollar, to $5.99 each month.\nThe subscription hike isn\u2019t limited to the U.S. market, with Spotify confirming that it will be increasing its prices in dozens of markets, including much of the European Union (EU), the U.K., and chunks of South and Central America, Asia and Oceania.\nThe company hasn\u2019t communicated prices for these markets yet, saying that those affected will start receiving emails from today confirming their new rates. However, the updated prices have started showing up on their local landing pages. It seems that Eurozone customers are seeing single-euro increases on the individual premium plan, although prices already vary across the region so the new price will depend on where you live \u2014 in Finland, for example, it has gone up \u20ac1 to \u20ac11.99 per month, whereas in France it has risen to \u20ac10.99. Germany, on the other hand, seems to be staying the same at \u20ac9.99 per month.\nIn the U.K., premium subscribers will pay an extra \u00a31 at \u00a310.99 a month.\nEarnings\nThe price increase is notable, insofar as it\u2019s the first time that Spotify has altered its main premium pricing plan in many of its core markets, including the U.S. and large parts of Europe, whereas streaming counterparts such as Netflix have regularly updated their pricing tiers through the years.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that today\u2019s announcement comes a day before Spotify is due to report its Q2 2023 earnings, with a price-hike one obvious conduit for the Swedish company to increase its revenues in its push toward sustained profitability \u2014 and, ultimately, keeping its shareholders happy.\nApple also increased its premium subscription from $9.99 to $10.99 last October, so today\u2019s news essentially aligns Spotify with its main music-streaming rival.\nReports surfaced earlier this year that Spotify is working on a new subscription plan that will give users access to higher-quality \u201clossless\u201d music, and is reportedly set to launch in the U.S. later this year with a tentative price of $19.99 per month.\n*This article was updated with clarification around the price increases in Europe.\n",

        "content": "The public transit sector in Kenya is driving the country\u2019s electric vehicle adoption as global calls for a switch to sustainable transport continue.\nFor the first time last year, commercial electric mass transport buses were deployed to various routes across Kenya\u2019s capital, Nairobi, marking the beginning of the transition from fossil fuel vehicles for some public bus operators. This came after electric motorcycle taxis, locally known as bodaboda, had already made inroads into the popular two-wheel public transport segment.\nThe current trend points at the possibility of Kenya\u2019s public transit sector maintaining its leadership of EV adoption, in contrast to most developed countries, where private vehicles are spearheading the transition.\nThis is likely to continue in the wake of increased production by startups eyeing the public transit sector, and the actualization of proposed tax incentives/exemptions and reliefs like the special power (charging) tariffs.\nKenya is making some strides and has zero rated supply of electric buses, and bicycles, and exempted imported and locally assembled motorcycles from excise duty, in the current finance act (which remains suspended).\n\nBasiGo to kick-off EV assembly in Kenya after $6.6M funding\n\nHaving the necessary legal and policy frameworks to encourage investment in the sector is equally important, said Moses Nderitu, the chief revenue officer of BasiGo, an EV startup and one of more than a dozen that have launched in the country\u2019s e-mobility space over the last five years.\n\u201cThis will be a positive boost since the EV sector is gaining traction in the country and for this momentum to be sustained, there needs to be backing from a legal standpoint,\u201d said Nderitu.\nOther countries making progress in the EV space according to Zeddy Bariti, a communications consultant with an interest in the energy sector, are South Africa, Rwanda, Namibia and Togo.\nBariti said these countries have \u201cvery aggressive tax policies\u201d that are meant to spur EV sector growth. However, while the policies are a step in the right direction, she said they haven\u2019t had much impact, in terms of spurring growth of the industries, in those countries so far.\nEV buses and motorcycles\nBasiGo has been operational in Kenya for the last two years, and has been enabling bus operators to switch from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. It already has 19 EV buses ferrying passengers across Nairobi, and targets to have 1,000 vehicles on Kenyan roads by 2025 \u2014 coming after the company began assembling the vehicles locally earlier this year. The company is using parts from China\u2019s EV maker BYD Automotive.\nRoam (previously Opibus) is another company that is building products for the mass transit sector in Kenya, and has ramped up the local production of EV buses. It is designing and developing its buses locally, and is on course to launch its first new and locally built EV bus in September, with projections of mass production beginning next year. This follows its 2021 plans to mass produce electric buses and motorcycles.\nRoam has been in Kenya\u2019s electric mobility space since 2017, but prior to its 2021 shift to manufacturing, which came after significant VC backing, it specialized in converting fossil-fuel vehicles to electric.\nMotorcycles by Roam are already on Kenyan roads, and the company recently opened an electric motorcycle manufacturing facility with production capacity of 50,000 units a year. It is anticipating producing 2,000 units by the end of the year.\nRoam, like nearly 10 other startups targeting the EV motorcycles market, is tapping bodaboda operators in Kenya and the larger East Africa region that are keen to save on fuel costs. The company says it has ensured the prices of its vehicles is almost commensurate with the commonly available ICE variants. It has also partnered with financing partners like M-Kopa to encourage the uptake of its motorcycles as it eyes the wider East and West African markets.\nRoam says it has built a hybrid solution for its motorcycle clientele. \u201cWhat that means is that they can actually charge the battery at home with the free portable charger, and they can also rent a battery. They get the best of both swapping and home charging,\u201d said Roam chief product and strategy officer, Albin Wilson.\nEV startup Roam\u2019s battery swapping station in Nairobi. Image Credits: Roam\nOther startups in the two-and-three-wheeler space include Kiri EV, Arc Ride, Ebee, Ampersand, Ecobodaa and Stimaboda.\nA 2023 e-mobility report by Kenya Power estimates that there are more than 1,350 electric-powered vehicles on Kenyan roads, with 62% being motorcycles. This report says annual registration of motorcycles has doubled over the last five years to 252,601, and that there are 1.2 million motorcycles in Kenya.\nBattery swapping stations\nBesides motorcycle sales, these startups have built battery swapping hubs across their regions of operations (mainly in Nairobi) creating a network of charging infrastructure that is wide enough for bodabodas to operate without worry of running out of charge or failing to find nearby swapping stations.\nBasiGo and Roam have built charging stations, and will continue widening their networks, as more buses are added on different routes.\nThe businesses are building the charging stations in anticipation of increased EV uptake, especially in the wake of a nearly 100% increase in diesel and gasoline prices over the last decade in Kenya, and the government\u2019s push for sustainable energy driving its climate change agenda. Kenya already generates over 90% of its power through renewable energy sources, including geothermal, wind and solar.\nArc Ride, a startup in the two-wheeler space, recently introduced to the Kenyan market its Corbett motorcycle, a crossover vehicle intended for delivery and travel. The company has also established an extensive network of battery swapping hubs in Nairobi, with its count currently at 60. The company\u2019s co-founder and CEO, Jo Hurst-Croft, told TechCrunch that they are on track to have 100 by September, and serving markets beyond Kenya. Arc Ride buyers do not own the batteries, which Hurst-Croft said makes the motorcycles costlier.\n\u201cArc Ride is planning on being the battery-as-a-service (BaaS) ecosystem of choice for other OEM\u2019s [original equipment manufacturer]. We will set up in two other countries next year and have a partnership that will launch soon in West Africa. Through setting the standard we can work with many companies to make BaaS a reality in the rapidly-growing African cities,\u201d said Hurst-Croft.\nAmpersand also signed an agreement with TotalEnergies, one of the largest petroleum products distributors in Kenya, to build a network of battery swapping and charging stations, starting with Nairobi.\nAs startups build charging infrastructure, state-run power utility company Kenya Power is building charging systems for businesses, homes and public places like gas stations. This is geared toward boosting the local EV uptake.\n\u201cPublic transport is a critical need in Kenya especially in our cities and EV sector players can plug in this to reduce tailpipe diesel emissions experienced daily,\u201d said Nderitu.\n\u201cThe private vehicle sector also has opportunities in EV, we are seeing this through the acceptance of hybrid vehicles in Kenya, only that the demand for this (EVs) is slower compared to that in the public transport sector.\u201d\nUpdated at 05:32 Eastern Time on July 26, 2023 to include a comment from Zeddy Bariti.\n\nEV conversion startup Opibus raises $7.5M to start bus and motorcycle mass production\n\n",

        "title": "5 key questions climate tech founders should ask impact investors",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nAgnes Svensson\nContributor\n\n\n\nAgnes Svensson is the chief impact officer at Norrsken VC, Europe's leading early-stage impact investor. She has more than 12 years\u2019 experience driving sustainability, diversity, and inclusion initiatives in the private sector (most notably the fintech decacorn Klarna) and at nonprofit organizations.\t\n\nThe world is witnessing an exciting and necessary surge in climate tech startups, with the impact tech sector up by 64% since the end of 2020. And with that increased supply, a new breed of investor has come to the fore: the impact VC.\nAs an impact specialist working within a VC, I\u2019m committed to supporting founders in achieving their ambitious goals and invoking positive change. To help drive more trackable impact investments, here are five key questions that all founders should consider asking impact investors competing for a space on your cap table.\nAre you actually an impact investment fund?\nFirst things first, you need to learn the jargon. The recent implementation of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) in the EU has brought clarity to fund categorizations. It\u2019s important to discern whether the investor is an Article 6, 8, or 9 fund; understand the difference and know what this means for you, as a founder.\nArticle 9 funds, like us, are exclusively focused on sustainable investments, with impact as an investment objective. They\u2019re also called \u201cdark green funds.\u201d One level down, we have Article 8 funds, which aim to promote environmental and social characteristics without an exclusive commitment to sustainability. That\u2019s a \u201clight green fund.\u201d Lastly, there\u2019s Article 6, otherwise known as \u201cgray funds.\u201d They make no claims of impact or sustainability, though they might dedicate some aspect of their funds to sustainable investments.\nIn addition to regulating funds under SFDR, the EU has provided guidance on what economic activities they consider to be environmentally and socially sustainable, and especially impactful. This is what\u2019s called the EU Taxonomy, a classification of business areas that warrants more capital, innovation, and attention, as these will truly move the needle for our planet and humanity.\nChoosing between Articles 8 and 9\nMost VCs operating today will fall into the Article 6 category, as generalists, so we\u2019ll exclude them outright here. For climate tech founders, opting for specialist impact investors (Article 8 or 9 funds), it\u2019s advisable to stay impact aligned. Currently, it\u2019s around 50-50 in Europe for impact VCs complying with either Article 8 or 9.\nWhen dealing with Article 8 funds, they will likely ask you to show that you align with several environmental or social criteria that they\u2019ve defined as especially important, such as the Principal Adverse Impact (PAI) indicators, which assess negative sustainability impacts of investment decisions or advice. They\u2019ll also show you how to identify and work to mitigate sustainability-related risks.\nArticle 9 funds do this and more, asking you to walk the talk. They\u2019ll demand more tangible evidence of what environmental or social impact your company is having, and how you can measure this over time. They emphasize the need to avoid causing significant harm and to run the business responsibly, both with internal operations and throughout the value chain.\nIt sounds like hard work but opting for an Article 9 fund offers several advantages. In many ways, Article 9 funds are often perceived as the \u201creal deal\u201d in the market, providing an impact stamp of approval within the investment syndicate that builds brand credibility in your startup. As your company grows, this status should give you access to pools of more diverse capital that non-impact companies cannot obtain.\nWhich impact key performance indicators (KPIs) do you prioritize?\nGiven the nuance of SFDR regulation, it\u2019s important for founders to challenge investors in defining what they call \u201cimpact\u201d and how they measure it. This is not a perfect science and is especially challenging when measuring the potential impact of early-stage companies that might be both pre-product and customer.",

        "content": "Cryptocurrency mobile wallet Zengo has introduced a handful of new features combined with a new premium subscription called Zengo Pro that costs $20 per month. This new, optional subscription brings additional security features for users who have a lot of crypto assets or who are really concerned about security in general \u2014 basic accounts remain free and the app has also been redesigned.\nAs a reminder, Zengo is a self-custodial wallet that uses multi-party computation. Unlike Metamask, a Zengo wallet can\u2019t be recovered using a seed phrase. This is important if you want to avoid phishing attempts. And unlike centralized exchanges like Coinbase, Zengo doesn\u2019t control your cryptocurrencies.\nIf you want to initiate a transaction from your Zengo wallet, all parties need to approve the transaction. In that case, the secret share stored on your device and the secret share stored on Zengo\u2019s server are required.\nIf you lose your phone or it stops working, you can recover your Zengo wallet on a new phone using the recovery file that is stored in one of your online cloud storage accounts, such as iCloud Drive or Dropbox. You also need to confirm the action from your email inbox and scan your face \u2014 more on that later.\nAnd things have been working well for Zengo, as the company managed to attract more than one million downloads. Overall, Zengo users have processed more than $1 billion in transaction volume.\n\u201cBut what we\u2019ve learned over the years is that there were plenty of use cases for which security had not been solved,\u201d co-founder and CEO Ouriel Ohayon told me.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve decided to do is launch a suite of security services called Zengo Pro, which is a paid subscription that brings these innovations to all blockchains. This could be solved by certain services on certain blockchains, but in our case it\u2019s bundled.\u201d\nBiometric withdrawal protection and legacy transfer\nIn particular, Zengo has identified two pain points that are rarely tackled by crypto wallets. First, what happens if someone steals your phone? As The Wall Street Journal already reported, if someone has access to your phone and knows your passcode, they can easily steal money from your financial apps and ruin your digital life.\nWith Zengo Pro, users can enable another layer of security for outgoing transactions. When you first create your Zengo wallet, the company scans your face and stores a 3D scan of your face. This isn\u2019t Face ID \u2014 it uses FaceTec\u2019s software technology for that feature.\nZengo Pro users can require a face scan for outgoing transactions. This way, even if your roommate knows your passcode, they can\u2019t empty your wallet behind your back. And if you\u2019re trying to send money to a scam, Zengo will also warn you with a new risk assessment system (a so-called \u201cweb3 firewall\u201d).\nSecond, Zengo is going to introduce a legacy transfer feature in the coming weeks. \u201cThe problem with inheritance is simple. What happens if you die \u2014 physically or digitally?\u201d Ohayon said. \u201cThere are extremely costly solutions involving lawyers or notaries.\u201d\nWith Zengo Pro, the company wants to create a software solution that is easier to set up. A user can invite someone they trust to become their legacy contact. The other person should install Zengo first. Both users will then get a shared secret that they can store on an online storage service like Dropbox.\nAfter a pre-defined inactivity phase, crypto assets are automatically transferred to the legacy contact. The maximum inactivity setting is 24 months without opening the app at least once.\nAnd yes, if the user dies and the Zengo Pro subscription can\u2019t be renewed because the payment method doesn\u2019t work anymore, Zengo will still transfer the assets after the inactivity phase.\nIn the future, Zengo also plans to add additional features to its pro subscription. Paid users can also reach out to customer support more easily. The legacy system will be improved as well, with the ability to add several contacts and define a split.\n\u201cMost wallet companies have business models that have shown their limits \u2014 including Ledger and including us until now. How do you create a revenue stream that is recurring, that is predictable, that aligns interests with the user interests without artificially trying to add fees here and there?\u201d Ohayon said.\nAnd this is key to understanding Zengo Pro. Many crypto companies generate more revenue when there is more trading activity. This creates some seasonality and it can be more difficult to survive during crypto winters.\nThat\u2019s probably also the reason why Zengo has secured additional fundings from new and existing investors \u2014 but the company isn\u2019t sharing the amount raised other than \u201cmillions of dollars.\u201d Yat Siu, the CEO of Animoca Brands, is investing in the crypto wallet for the first time.\n\u201cBecause creating a wallet is expensive. Here, we bring an innovative business model that enables us to create a recurring, sustainable model controlled by the wallet company,\u201d Ohayon said.\n",

Individuals can download World App, the startup\u2019s protocol-compatible wallet software, and visit an Orb, the startup\u2019s helmet-shaped eyeball-scanning verification device, to receive their World ID.\nAs TechCrunch has previously noted, Worldcoin is perhaps one of the most audacious efforts to bribe the world to embrace their currency. The startup, founded by OpenAI CEO Altman and Alex Blania, wants to put a crypto wallet (and some of their currency) onto every human\u2019s smartphone, but in order to do so they have to build a way to determine whether someone is a unique human.\nWorldcoin, in the works for over three years, has been quietly signing up individuals in many countries, including India, giving those onboarding 25 Worldcoin tokens. But the journey so far hasn\u2019t been very smooth. The project has received criticism for exploitative practices in poor countries. Between May 2021 and July 2023, more than 2 million individuals verified their World IDs at an Orb across more than 30 different countries, the startup said.\n\n\nSam Altman's Worldcoin salespeople/volunteers/whatever have reached the neighborhood.  25 tokens for your retina scan.

For the first 15 years, the startup is capping the total supply to 10 billion \u201cWLD\u201d tokens, it said (more on this below). At launch on Monday, the maximum circulating supply of the token, which is ERC-20 based, is 143 million, Worldcoin writes in a whitepaper.\n\u201cIf successful, we believe Worldcoin could drastically increase economic opportunity, scale a reliable solution for distinguishing humans for AI online while preserving private, enable global democratic processes, and eventually show a potential path to AI-funded UBI,\u201d said the statement in a statement.\nWorldcoin is an \u201cattempt at global scale alignment,\u201d it said, prompting a jab from\u00a0Jack Dorsey, Twitter co-founder and no stranger to the world of cryptocurrency, who found it \u201ccute.\u201d\nWorldcoin tokenomics\n  \n",

Your usual host Kirsten Korosec is still away, so you have me for one more week. Let\u2019s jump in.\nU.S. policymakers and agencies are looking for ways to regulate autonomous vehicles on a larger scale.\nFirst, there\u2019s the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which plans to announce a new rule-making in September that could benefit AV companies like Cruise and Zoox, both of which have plans to launch purpose-built robotaxis that don\u2019t have steering wheels or pedals.\nGeneral Motors, which owns Cruise, submitted a petition in February 2022 to NHTSA to deploy up to 2,500 of the Cruise Origins annually without human controls and may soon have an answer.\nAt a congressional level, lawmakers will host a hearing on July 26 aimed at reviving long-delayed legislation on the safe and regulated adoption of self-driving cars. The panel will consider separate draft legislation from Representative Bob Latta (R-OH) and Representative Debbie Dingell (D-MI).\nThe hearing will be convened by a House subcommittee titled \u201cSelf-Driving Vehicle Legislative Framework: Enhancing Safety, Improving Lives and Mobility, and Beating China.\u201d That last bit is important. American industry for decades has used the threat of some other great superpower gaining the upper hand as a narrative to drive forward technological progress, for better or worse.\n\nBefore we dive in, a quick highlight of my TechCrunch+ story this week that looks into Tesla\u2019s stock price, which has dropped about 10% since the company reported Q2 earnings (more on that below), and why it\u2019s priced as a tech company when its margins scream automaker.\nWant to reach out with a tip, comment or complaint?

VanMoof is considering a third-party sale so that its activities can continue. Those activities being the highly customized parts and the unique digital unlock key that\u2019s connected to VanMoof\u2019s servers. We reported that Cowboy came up with an app to let VanMoof owners retail digital keys to their bikes, but the access is limited.\nTechCrunch how the company managed to go bankrupt in a booming e-bike market. One industry insider told us that VanMoof spent big on marketing and over-ordering and neglected to think about supply chain and unit costs.\nAs TC\u2019s Ingrid Lunden pointed out: \u201cIf the unit economics of the bikes never worked out, and an app can be built in a day to unlock those bikes that are in the market already, why would anyone want to assume the assets of the failed startup?\u201d\nIn other news\u2026\nBird is officially back in compliance with the NYSE.\nLondon-based bike-share HumanForest has launched a new feature, Forest Parcel, to provide a zero-emission, on-demand parcel-delivery service.\nTaur, the front-facing scooter manufacturer, has launched its second model, the Taur II, on Kickstarter. The scooter has up to 40 miles of range.\nTaur also started a campaign to challenge the U.K. government on their stance on owned scooters, which are still illegal to ride on public roads. There are, however, shared scooter pilots, which often serve to sway government and public opinion away from scooters as a viable transportation option due to the behavior of renters and potential for street clutter. The company said it would reimburse the fines of any Taur customer who is fined by the police for riding on U.K. roads. And if the scooter is confiscated, Taur will replace it free of charge.\nCommsignia launched a V2X device for e-bikes and other micromobility vehicles that broadcasts messages about the cyclist\u2019s position and direction from other road users. It also receives messages from other vehicles and alerts the rider to potential hazards.\nDeal of the week\n\nAutonomous vehicle company Aurora Innovation has sold $820 million worth of stock. About $220 million came from a public offering that priced the stock at $3 per share, and the remaining $600 million came from a concurrent private offering of stock priced at $2.70.\nAurora, a pre-revenue company building frontier technology, has been spending a pretty penny in its pursuit of commercializing self-driving trucks by the end of 2024. In 2022, the company lost about $1.7 billion.\nAurora hasn\u2019t been shy about its need to raise more funds in order to make it to commercialization and beyond. The company said it has about $785 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30, 2023. This infusion of capital gives Aurora another $1.6 billion to play around with. The company is hoping the funds will take it \u201cwell into 2025.\u201d\nOther deals that got my attention\u2026\nAlpha Grid, a San Francisco\u2013based EV charging deployment optimization startup, raised a $2.5 million pre-seed led by Asymmetric Capital Partners.

Maka will start deploying its first pilot EVs this month and is aiming for volume production in late 2024.\nRedwood Materials, the battery recycling startup founded by Tesla co-founder J.B. Straubel, is reportedly in talks to raise $700 million at a $5 billion valuation. The company would not confirm the reports.\nHong Kong\u2013based delivery robot startup Rice Robotics raised $7 million in additional seed funding from Alibaba Entrepreneurs Fund, Soul Capital, Audacy Ventures and others.\nFreightFriend, a platform for capacity and freight management tools, was acquired by Truckstop.

The camera-based Intelligent Speed Assist is launching in production vehicles this year and lets cars sense speed limits without needing to rely on third-party map and GPS data.\nAutonomous vehicles\nCruise\u2019s full-page ad in several newspapers calling humans terrible drivers got the attention of the former NHTSA head. \u201cUsing the pain and suffering of those deaths for self-promotion of an unproven and unsafe product is unscrupulous,\u201d said Joan Claybrook.\nSpeaking of Cruise, the company has officially started initial robotaxi testing in Miami.\nAnother Cruise-related issue. The California Public Utilities Commission \u2014 the agency that has the power to give Cruise and Waymo final sign-off on their plans to expand commercial robotaxi services across San Francisco 24/7 \u2014 had planned to \u00a0question the two companies over how they will deal with robotaxis malfunctioning and blocking access from first responders. Update: The July 31 meeting has been cancelled.\nKodiak Robotics is working with Drivewyze to launch a weigh station program for self-driving trucks on Texas interstates. The goal is to address how trucks will handle weigh station inspections without a driver present to facilitate the process.\nEarnings\nOnline used car retailer Carvana reported higher-than-expected earnings of $2.96 billion in Q2, with adjusted EBITDA totaling $155 million. The company sold 76,530 cars during the quarter, which was slightly fewer than expected by analysts.\nCarvana also announced it will reduce its outstanding debt by over $1.2 billion by exchanging existing unsecured debt with new notes. The company might also sell up to $350 million in new stock as part of the restructure.\nThe combined news of healthy earnings and debt exchange deal caused Carvana\u2019s stock to spike Wednesday as high as $60.90. The company\u2019s stock has come back down to earth somewhat, settling at around $47 Thursday at market close.\nTesla hit $25 billion in revenue in the second quarter, which just beat Wall Street estimates. Despite the record revenue, Tesla\u2019s stock started to slide in after-hours and the next day by as much as 10%. That was likely a response to Tesla\u2019s continued hit to automotive gross margins after a series of price cuts. Margins slid to around 18%, which is down from the 25% Tesla was rocking a year ago.\nTesla also reported that solar installations are slipping, but energy storage installations saw a boost in the second quarter.\nElectric vehicles\nFord has slashed the price of its F-150 Lightning, in some trims by as much as $10,000. The automaker cited manufacturing efficiencies as the cause of the lower price.\nFord is also being questioned by House Republicans over its battery cell technology deal with China\u2019s CATL in its upcoming $3.5 billion battery cell plant in Michigan.\nGeneral Motors is experiencing downtime at its CAMI plant in Canada (which builds the BrightDrop commercial EVs) in order to manage parts-availability issues. Regular operations will resume July 31, and it won\u2019t affect GM\u2019s overall EV production targets in North America \u2014 50,000 in the first half and 100,000 in the second.\nRemember the Kia Boys? The people who had been following a viral trend on TikTok to steal Kias using a USB cord? A 14-year-old Texas boy has been linked to nearly 40 thefts.\nThe NHTSA has opened up its third special investigation into a Tesla crash this year. This is related to a fatal crash involving a 2018 Model 3 and connected to the vehicle\u2019s Autopilot system.\nNissan has joined the ranks of automakers that have adopted Tesla\u2019s NACS charging standard for its Ariya and future EV models.\nRivian can move ahead with its EV facility production plans in Georgia after the state\u2019s Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to the validity of about $700 million in tax breaks the EV startup expects to receive.\nStellantis has signed $11.2 billion worth of contracts through 2030 to secure semiconductors needed for its EVs and high-performance computing functions.\nIndia\u2019s Tata Motors plans to build a 40 GWh battery cell gigafactory in the United Kingdom. The over $5.16 billion investment will deliver batteries for JLR and Tata Motors, with supplies beginning in 2026.\nVietnam\u2019s VinFast will hold a groundbreaking ceremony at its electric vehicle factory in North Carolina on July 28. The company expects to invest $4 billion in the factory, which is designed to reach a capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year.\nVolkswagen\u2019s Knoxville Innovation Hub has published research breakthroughs to increase EV range and recycle vehicle materials, the company said. These include a wireless EV charging concept.\nTeslaCrunch\nIt was another big week of Tesla news, especially with the automaker kicking off earnings season. Let\u2019s dive in.\nDuring Tesla\u2019s Q2 earnings call, Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla was in talks with a major OEM to license its FSD software and hardware out to them. FSD (\u201cfull self-driving\u201d) is Tesla\u2019s advanced driver assistance system that is NOT fully autonomous, despite the tech\u2019s confusing name. Musk also said that for Q3 only, Tesla owners looking to upgrade to newer models could transfer their FSD over.\nEarlier in the week, Tesla announced that drivers with home solar and a Powerwall charger now have an in-app option to exclusively charge up their vehicle via excess solar energy.\nThe automaker also showed off its first Cybertruck built at Giga Texas over the weekend, to much fanfare but few specifics. We\u2019re still wondering about production capacity and price, which were not addressed during the earnings call.\nOutside the U.S., Tesla is hoping to expand its German factory, but residents want assurances on water use, biodiversity protection and environmental impact.\nAlso, Tesla directors, including Musk, will have to pay $735 million back to the company to settle claims from shareholders that they excessively overpaid themselves. As part of the deal, the directors also agreed not to receive compensation for 2021, 2022 and 2023.\nMiscellaneous\nByteDance\u2019s Douyin (the Chinese version of TikTok) is doing food delivery now? So food delivery giant Meituan decided to add more video to its app in kind.\nPolicymakers have introduced a bill that would increase fuel taxes for private jet travel from the current $0.22 to $1.95 per gallon, and remove existing fuel tax exemptions for logging and oil or gas exploration. The idea is that if the rich want to pollute our skies, they can pay extra. The revenue generated by the so-called FATCAT Act would be transferred to a fund that would support air monitoring for environmental justice communities.\nSpotify is bringing a new experience to Teslas that will make displaying content bolder and more accessible. Drivers can take advantage of features like QR codes for easy log-in, access to audiobooks, and one-touch jump to artists and album pages.\nUber Freight has laid off almost 50 brokerage employees.\nPeople\nEVTOL startup Archer has brought on Nikhil Goel, co-founder of Uber Elevate, as the company\u2019s chief commercial officer. This comes on the heels of adding former FAA administrator Billy Nolen.\nRide-hail\nInDrive has launched its bid-based ride-hail app in Miami, its first U.S. market. The company\u2019s business model is based on customers naming their own fare and nearby drivers accepting, declining or countering the offer.\nRevel, the Brooklyn-based startup doing shared e-mopeds, EV charging hubs and an all-electric, all-employee ride-hail service, announced that it has hired over 1,000 New Yorkers as Q2 employee drivers.\nThe California Supreme Court rejected an argument by Uber that hoped to limit the ability of its drivers to take employment-related disputes to court. The court unanimously determined that the defendant, driver Erik Adolph, couldn\u2019t sign away his right to represent his peers in a class-action lawsuit, even though his contract requires him to take any employment-related disputes to arbitration. This ruling could have ripple effects in the gig economy space.\n\nBeep beep!

        "title": "Can Europe\u2019s cannabis market avoid the US\u2019 mistakes? Investors chime in",
        "content": "When it comes to Europe\u2019s cannabis market, the biggest piece of news this year is what didn\u2019t happen. Contrary to what a lot of people expected, Germany isn\u2019t on the way to legalizing recreational use of marijuana. Instead, the EU\u2019s most populated country watered down its law reform plans after liaising with regulators.\nIs Germany\u2019s decision and the precedent it has set bad news for VCs who invest in cannabis startups in Europe? Not necessarily, and it could even be good news for some. According to Oliver Lamb, co-founder of \u00d3skare Capital, Germany\u2019s \u201cpush to slow down the legalization of recreational cannabis is positive for the medical and pharmaceutical market.\u201d\n\u201cThe hybrid recreational-medical experiment has already been played out in North America, and there were a painful amount of lessons learned that it would be reckless to ignore,\u201d he said.\nLamb, like other investors, is wary of the mistakes they\u2019ve seen being made in the U.S.: \u201cThe blurred line between the medical and recreational sectors has undoubtedly been to the detriment of targeted medication development,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is crucial to use lessons from paths that others have laid before you. In New York, we\u2019ve seen a failure to do this, with just a handful of dispensaries up and running alongside lax law enforcement, which led to an overt and booming illicit market,\u201d said Matt Hawkins, founder and managing partner at Entourage Effect Capital.\nHowever, some funds are worried that the total addressable market for legal cannabis on the continent is limited and has been affected by Germany\u2019s decision. \u201cThe scaling back by Germany has made us more hesitant to deploy capital in Europe,\u201d Hawkins said. \u201cGermany\u2019s process has indicated the entire continent will struggle to create a commercial adult-use market in the coming years and have a limited TAM.\u201d\nSimilarly, like other private businesses looking to raise venture capital, cannabis startups aren\u2019t immune to the global repricing that investors are pushing for. \u201cEuropean cannabis companies are still overvalued,\u201d said Emily Paxhia, co-founder and managing partner at Poseidon Investment Management.\nFor founders of cannabis-related startups hoping to weather the slowdown, the advice isn\u2019t very different from what all entrepreneurs are being told at the moment: survive and advance. That\u2019s Poseidon\u2019s motto, Paxhia said.\nFor cannabis companies that know they won\u2019t survive, finding a buyer seems to be a viable option, as consolidation is expected in the coming months. But whether we are talking about investments or M&A, we are in a strong buyer\u2019s market, Lamb warned.\nRead on to find out where these investors see the next opportunity, how they plan to tackle the market following Germany\u2019s decision, and how to best pitch them.\nWe spoke with:\n\nOliver Lamb, co-founder, \u00d3skare Capital\nEmily Paxhia, co-founder and managing partner, Poseidon Investment Management\nMatt Hawkins, founder and managing partner, Entourage Effect Capital\n\n\nOliver Lamb, co-founder, \u00d3skare Capital\nIs cannabis more legally accessible in Europe this year than it was when we conducted our previous survey last year? Have there been any key regulatory changes at play?\nOn the medical side, cannabinoid therapeutics and non-cannabinoid therapeutics (i.e., therapeutics that modulate the endocannabinoid system but do so without cannabinoids) are notably increasing in availability.\nThere are many factors at play that explain this shift, amongst them [being] increases in tailwinds and reductions in headwinds. Today we have more, higher quality clinical data demonstrating the efficacy of these medications for various conditions, coupled with an uptick in highly qualified teams that are bringing these medications to market.\nAs for the tailwinds, difficulties in patient access have long hindered prescriptions of medications that target the endocannabinoid system (the mammalian regulatory system that reacts to cannabinoids and cannabinoid-like molecules, similar to the central nervous system).\nHowever, we are excited to see a number of technologies and platforms linking specialized doctors with patients in need of these medications. One such example is Leva, whose digital clinic is tackling the vastly underserved chronic pain market in the U.K.\nAlongside this, there is a growing acceptance within medical communities of the suitability of ECS-modulating medications for certain pathologies. At a conference in Berlin this month, a founder happily relayed that a recent meeting of general practitioners dedicated two hours to talk about medical cannabinoids. This is a clear indicator of the increasing understanding and adoption of these medications by doctors across Europe.\nAside from watered-down plans to legalize recreational use, Germany imported a record amount of marijuana for medical and scientific use in 2022. Is this taking focus away from the fact that imports are slowing?\nAlthough Germany\u2019s decision was undoubtedly unpopular at companies that bet on the legislation going in the opposite direction, this push to slow down the legalization of recreational cannabis is positive for the medical and pharmaceutical market.\nThe hybrid recreational-medical experiment has already been played out in North America, and there were a painful amount of lessons learned that it would be reckless to ignore. Specifically, legalizing recreational cannabis in tandem with medical use in North America can be seen to have diminished the incentives for researchers to develop targeted therapeutics for specific pathologies, given the flood of cannabis flower being distributed through dispensaries. That happened despite a preference held by the majority of doctors to prescribe targeted and licensed treatment that does not need to be smoked.\nThe North American approach also blurred the lines between the recreational and medical markets, strengthening the impression that users of such therapeutics were simply prioritizing pleasure while claiming a genuine need.\nThis misconception is not only counterproductive for patients looking for proven treatments, [but] it also detracts attention from the fact that ECS-modulating medications can provide not only far superior side-effect profiles compared to traditional pharmaceuticals such as opiates, but also treatments for conditions that are currently untreatable.\nThe Czech Republic might end up legalizing recreational cannabis use before Germany, but it is a smaller market. Is it big enough to move the needle and find out what the EU will tolerate?\nPeter Lynch once noted that if you spend 13 minutes a year on economics, you\u2019ve wasted 10 minutes. Politics is arguably the same. Influences on international regulation are vast and varied, and even if you have a good idea of the outcome, the timings are just as complicated to predict.\nTherefore, as a rule, we don\u2019t bet on regulation. Instead, we invest in what we know: strong teams, innovative science and untapped market opportunities. We select our investments assuming that the regulatory landscape is fixed as it is today. That way, if nothing changes, we know that they can succeed regardless, and as and when things continue to open up, they can be positioned to benefit further.\nA prediction I do feel confident in making is that governments and medical communities will continue to gain understanding of the benefits of these medications.\nHow has your approach to investing in the cannabis sector changed in the last 12 months? What are your expectations for the next 12 months? Is consolidation in the cards in that period?\nWith regards to our thesis, not at all. We started by focusing on Europe and continue to do so. Likewise, we launched the fund to target life sciences and deep tech investments in the sector, and this remains unchanged, largely due to the fact that our portfolio is performing very well.\nIt\u2019s also gratifying to see that a number of U.S. funds are now looking to Europe for the next wave of growth in the sector. This is an asset, as we like to syndicate rounds and having stakeholders across the pond is often helpful when it comes to intercontinental expansion.\nHere are our predictions for this year, and those we made for 2022 are here.\nWe\u2019re happy to say that most of our past predictions have come to fruition, and those for this year are on track to do the same.\nWhat advice are you giving your cannabis-related portfolio companies right now in terms of preserving or extending their runway?",

Or soon-to-be-former-bird-app, actually.\nMusk tweeted late Saturday night that he\u2019d replace the Twitter bird logo with an \u201cX\u201d logo as soon as Sunday or Monday \u201cworldwide,\u201d provided he got a good-looking enough one submitted in time.

Twitter\u2019s \u201cCEO\u201d Linda Yaccarino so far hasn\u2019t chimed in on the change on her own account, despite ostensibly leading the company Musk overpaid for late last year. Twitter couldn\u2019t be reached for comment because, like a child, Elon has replaced the media contact email with a bot that auto responds on a frustrating and endless loop.\nAlso like a child, Musk seems intent on naming everything \u201cX\u201d just because he likes it and is fixated on it (there\u2019s an x in fixated \u2014 hope you liked that one Elon); he\u2019s named his new AI company \u201cx.AI\u201d\u00a0and literally will not shut up about how badly he wanted X to be the name for PayPal when his original company with that name merged with another to make the online payments giant.\nAs of this writing, Twitter is still Twitter and the blue bird still flies, but that could change at any moment, as with everything this fickle billionaire touches these days.\n",

        "content": "In March, DPReview announced that parent company Amazon was shutting it down, and the photography world entered a dual state of shock and disbelief.\nFor 25 years, DPReview had served as a consistently reliable and authoritative voice on photography gear. But photography enthusiasts didn\u2019t just go to DPReview to drool over Canon\u2019s newest lens or compare Sony and Nikon\u2019s face-detection autofocusing capabilities. It was an active forum where we (yes, I\u2019m one of those photography people) could hang out and geek out.\nThat such an extensive archive of photography knowledge and the strong community it had fostered was being banished to the abyss \u2014 the plan wasn\u2019t even to archive it\u00a0but to switch it off completely \u2014 was a blow to many. The announcement on DPReview garnered over 5,000 comments, and people took to social media to share their thoughts about Amazon\u2019s decision.\n\nStartups, be careful who you sell to\n\n\u00a0\nBut that soon changed when Gear Patrol \u2014 which offers advice, how-tos and product reviews, but not specific to cameras \u2014 came to the rescue. It finalized a deal to purchase DPReview from Amazon for an undisclosed sum in June 2023. I was excited to speak to Eric Yang, Gear Patrol\u2019s founder and CEO, to find out what motivated the purchase and what he learned from the process.\nAuthority and community\nYang was driven to bring DPReview under the Gear Patrol aegis for several reasons, and while it made business sense, there was a personal motivation there, too.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a business, so it\u2019s not a totally altruistic endeavor,\u201d Yang told me. \u201cBut DPReview is very meaningful to me. It\u2019s meaningful to a lot of people, I think, who have grown up on the internet.\u201d\nDPReview is home to an extraordinary knowledge base that Yang was reluctant to see disappear. But this knowledge base doesn\u2019t reside just in its vast archive of reviews, buying guides, editorials and advice; it\u2019s also in the strong community that this expertise fostered. For so many people, DPReview was a safe place to express opinions, ask for advice, or just be photography geeks. All of this, together, was valuable to Yang.\nA natural fit\nYang describes Gear Patrol as a place that empowers people to pursue their interests and passions with confidence, which is why he believes that Gear Patrol and DPReview are a natural fit. \u201cWe want to help people have the knowledge that they need to pursue their particular passions in the best possible way,\u201d Yang said.",

        "title": "FedNow may finally be live, but will it be too costly for businesses to adopt?",
        "content": "Welcome to The Interchange! If you want this in your inbox, sign up here. It was an event-filled week in the fintech world, what with FedNow launching, the former CEO of fintech Bolt \u2014 and the company itself \u2014 being\u00a0subpoenaed by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission and much more. Let\u2019s drill down here.\nIt\u2019s about time\nLast week, the U.S. government\u2019s instant payment system, FedNow Service, finally went live.\nFedNow is an instant payment infrastructure for transferring money that promises to be a faster payment rail for financial institutions, offering immediate access to funds no matter the day or time. As you know, this is huge because banks aren\u2019t traditionally open 24/7 or let you receive money and use it on the same day.\nIt\u2019s also something that the U.S. has been considered \u201cbehind\u201d on in light even though other countries have been live with similar services for some time, including Brazil, India, the United Kingdom and the European Union. In fact, anecdotally, we hear that in Brazil, the country\u2019s similar system, Pix, is so commonplace that people are even using it over credit cards to pay street vendors. And there\u2019s data to back that up, too.\nWe did a deep dive on what the long-awaited launch of the service might mean for the U.S. on Friday. But one thing we didn\u2019t touch on: how banks choose to price FedNow to their customers and how that might impact how quickly it is adopted.\nVia email, Adam Shapiro, a partner at financial services advisory and investment firm Klaros Group, noted that the Fed charges banks around 4 cents for a FedNow payment, compared to less than half a cent for an ACH payment. However, he added, banks are free to charge customers what they like for these payments. As such, according to Shapiro, \u201cbusiness customers that are deciding which to use may be deterred if banks make FedNow significantly more expensive than ACH.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cA business may be prepared to pay 3.5 cents to get someone money faster, but draw the line at paying 25 cents. Also, how fraud is handled and where liability falls should something go wrong will shape adoption.\u201d\nWeekly News\nChristine reported on the fact that a letter authored in April by a lawyer representing Bolt investors said the SEC was investigating whether federal securities laws were violated in connection with statements made when Bolt was raising money in 2021. The letter was sent to Bolt\u2019s general counsel as part of a fact-finding mission. Per a letter referenced by The Information, Brian Reinken of WestCap Management and Arjun Sethi of Tribe Capital Management, investors in Bolt\u2019s Series C and Series B rounds, respectively, demanded to look at the company\u2019s records, claiming that ex-CEO Ryan Breslow allegedly \u201cmisled\u201d investors while fundraising for the company\u2019s $355 million Series E round.\u00a0You may recall that Breslow had stepped down from his role as CEO in January of 2022.\nMary Ann teamed up with Rebecca Szkutak to look at just how far fintech valuations have fallen since the heydays of the venture boom (see graph below). Unsurprisingly, valuations for most of the highest valued fintech companies are down, with three notable exceptions \u2014 all of whom operate in the same space. They looked at valuations based on secondary share activity (as analyzed by Notice.co), which some argue may be a more accurate reflection of what a company is worth than public valuations at the time of a fundraise. They also talked to a few industry experts to get a sense of what\u2019s ahead. Check it out here:\u00a0 Fintech valuations have fallen. Where do they go from here? (TC+)\nTC\u2019s Alex Wilhelm and Anna Heim did a deep dive into the world of insurtech for TechCrunch+, noting that while some industries were able to get over the hump of inflated valuations from 2021, this industry didn\u2019t seem to be one of them. So much so that one report called it the \u201cdeath of insurtech 1.0.\u201d Alex and Anna look at how global startups fared, and if there are signs that this industry can indeed recover. (TC+)\nReporter Dominic-Madori Davis wrote about the aftermath of an acquisition involving neobank Greenwood, which caters to Black and Latino customers, and The Gathering Spot, a networking club with similar interests. As you will see, everything was going well\u2026until it didn\u2019t. Now there are sour feelings and a lawsuit. Though none of the parties commented, Dominic-Madori details what went wrong. The debate of whether niche-focused neobanks will ultimately prove successful continues as Daylight, another neobank focused on the LGBTQ+ community, recently shut down.\nGet your palm ready! Reporter Sarah Perez covered Amazon\u2019s palm-scanning payment technology coming to all 500 Amazon-owned Whole Foods stores by the end of the year. Here\u2019s how it works: Utilizing a biometric payment system, the customers hover their palm above a reader device that identifies the individual\u2019s unique palm signature and associates it with the customer\u2019s payment card on file in order to charge them for their purchases. Don\u2019t worry, your palm data is not shared.\nMedical procedures often involve a complicated web of bills and payments that can stretch for months or even years later. I (Christine) personally had a collections agency chase after me for a $50 urine test (I was 21 years old and didn\u2019t know better), so I can imagine what it\u2019s like for someone owing thousands of dollars in medical fees. This week I wrote about Collectly, a company that developed proprietary interfaces that integrate with electronic health records and practice management software to make patient billing operations easier.\u00a0 By making it easier to pay, the company touts that medical company customers were, on average, able to increase patient collections for medical group partners by 75%, reducing the \u201cdays sales outstanding\u201d to 12 days from between 60 and 90 days. Though Collectly\u2019s customers are the medical offices, I\u2019d like to think that the digitizing of medical bills is something that can help patients, too. Who wouldn\u2019t want a one-click way to access and pay all the bills associated with a procedure?\nCB Insights released its Q2 State of Fintech Report last week, and unsurprisingly, global funding in the space was down \u2014 plunging by nearly half to $7.8 billion, its lowest level since 2017. But at least one region didn\u2019t have a bad quarter. Can you guess which one it was? Meanwhile, payments \u2014 which has historically been the darling of the fintech space \u2014 didn\u2019t have a great three months. Read more here.\nVisa and Mastercard were hit with an antitrust suit by fintech company Block. In a suit filed July 14 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Block alleges the two credit card giants \u201cconspired to vastly overcharge the Square payment platform, causing higher retail prices paid by consumers,\u201d by inflating interchange fees as a way to maintain market share, according to a Bloomberg report.\nTech giant Apple in late March finally launched its Apple Pay Later service, which allows users to split the cost of an Apple Pay purchase into four equal payments over six weeks without interest or late fees. The move put Apple in direct competition with the likes of Affirm, PayPal and Klarna. How\u2019s it going so far? Well, according to J.D. Power, pretty darn good. A recent report found that about a fifth of BNPL (buy now, pay later) customers said they used Apple Pay Later in its first three months. Additionally, the report also revealed that Apple has \u201ca potentially more stable, sustainable user base than competitors do. And beyond that, data suggest it may be attracting first time BNPL users that might not otherwise consider BNPL as an option.\u201d This all led J.D. Power to conclude: \u201cThere are no guarantees, but Apple Pay Later has got a lot going for it \u2014 [this] is a nice thing to have in general, and especially when Apple itself is diving further into financial services.\u201d\nImage Credits: Miranda Halpern / TechCrunch\nOther headlines\nDaffy for Work is a type of \u2018charitable 401(k)\u2019 that could unlock billions for US charities\nSundae set out to build a kinder way to buy run-down homes (TechCrunch reported on the company\u2019s 2021 raise here.)\nToast axes 99-cent fee\nVest and Sproutfi team up to boost investments in the US\nNuvei and Plaid team to expand pay-by-bank\u00a0\nAirwallex joins Brex in expanding international presence\nFundings and M&A\nSeen on TechCrunch\nThunes pockets $72M at a $900M+ valuation to expand its cross-border, B2B payment platform\nKarat, a startup building financial tools for content creators, raises $70M\nCognaize raises $18M to build a better LLM for the finance sector, one that keeps humans in the loop\nRunway lands $27.5M to streamline financial planning for businesses\nAddition leads $6M seed round in Egyptian fintech Flash\u00a0\nSeen elsewhere\nAnduin, which empowers investor relationships in private markets, announces $15M Series B\nNav Acquires Tillful to Accelerate Data Platform Development\u00a0\nDo you Mynd?

That\u2019s why WiR exists \u2014 we\u2019ll get you caught up to speed.\nThis edition of WiR features pieces about a fake AI-generated \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode; the surging downloads of Threads, an app that shares the same name as Meta\u2019s Twitter competitor; and Tesla\u2019s first Cybertruck build. We also recap the CEO of OnlyFans stepping down; Wix\u2019s new tool that can create websites on the fly, using generative AI; and Plex\u2019s free Winamp-inspired music player.\nThat\u2019s a lot to cover, so let\u2019s get cracking. Oh, and if you haven\u2019t already, sign up here\u00a0to get WiR in your inbox every Saturday.\nMost read\nPoor timing for AI-generated TV: AI startup Fable Studios demoed its platform this week, using it to create a full, fake \u201cSouth Park\u201d episode in which Cartman tries to apply deepfake technology to the media industry. The tech was impressive, Devin writes, but \u2014 juxtaposed against the ongoing strike of creatives in TV and film \u2014 the stunt came across as a tad inartful.\nNot a good look for Microsoft security: Microsoft still doesn\u2019t know \u2014 or want to share \u2014 how China-backed hackers stole a key that allowed them to stealthily break into dozens of email inboxes, including those belonging to several government agencies. The company first disclosed the incident last Tuesday, attributing the monthlong activity to a newly discovered espionage group it\u2019s calling Storm-0558, which it believes has a strong nexus to China.\nThe other Threads surges to new heights: Instagram\u2019s\u00a0Twitter clone Threads\u00a0enjoyed a fairly fruitful first week in existence, sailing past\u00a030 million users in the first 24 hours. But it\u2019s had the unintended effect of thrusting Threads, an unrelated app first pitched as a Slack alternative, into the spotlight. Threads (the Slack alternative) reportedly racked up more than 880,000 downloads on iOS between July 6 and July 12, after Meta\u2019s Threads launched, having had few downloads prior to this point.\nTelsa unveils the first Cybertruck build: Tesla over the weekend said its first, much-anticipated Cybertruck came off the production line in Texas. The debut of the long-delayed, futuristic-looking pickup truck comes in the lead-up to Tesla\u2019s second-quarter 2023 earnings call.\nOnlyFans CEO steps down: After about two and a half years at the helm, Ami Gan is leaving OnlyFans. Chief strategy and operations officer Keily Blair will take over as CEO. As Amanda writes,\u00a0OnlyFans is perhaps the best-known creator platform that supports adult content; according to Gan, the company paid out\u00a0$10 billion to creators while she was CEO.\nNew sites, generated by AI: Wix, a longtime fixture of the web-building space, is betting that today\u2019s customers don\u2019t particularly care to spend time customizing every aspect of their site\u2019s appearance. The company\u2019s new AI Site Generator tool, announced this week, will allow Wix users to describe their intent and generate a website complete with a homepage, inner pages and text and images \u2014 as well as business-specific sections for events, bookings and more.\nPlex makes its Winamp-inspired player free: Plexamp, the music player\u00a0originally incubated by the Labs division of media company Plex, is now free. The project was first\u00a0launched in 2017 as a subscription-based spin on the classic Winamp media player app, offering visualizations to accompany your tunes, tools for programming mixes, and more recently, a ChatGPT-powered \u201cSonic Sage\u201d feature that builds unique playlists from users\u2019 music libraries.\nVanMoof e-bikes, saved: Since struggling\u00a0e-bike startup VanMoof confirmed it has asked for a deferment of payment in Holland, there\u2019s been a question hanging over the VanMoof bikes out there in the wild. Riding to the rescue, somewhat improbably, is Cowboy, VanMoof\u2019s e-bike competitor over the border in Belgium. Cowboy\u2019s \u201cBikey\u201d app enables VanMoof riders to generate their unique digital key and keep riding, Mike writes.\nAudio\nTechCrunch\u2019s roster of podcasts is, as the kids say,\u00a0giving. Tune in for great new content this week.\nOn Equity, PitchBook venture guru Kyle Stanford came to riff with the crew on the venture capital in Q2 2023: the good, the bad, and the late stage.\nThe latest episode of Found, meanwhile, spotlighted Catherine Tabor, the founder and CEO of Sparkfly, a company that helps brands with marketing and customer engagement. Tabor talked about building a company fluid enough to adapt to changing technology trends over the last decade and how she was dismissed by venture capitalists despite landing notable customers.\nTechCrunch+\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber.

Yet they also appear to be some of the most hesitant. Startups are taking advantage of the situation, Tim writes.\nMixed-gender founding teams raise over a billion dollars: U.S. startups with mixed-gender founding teams \u2014 meaning they have at least one female founder \u2014 raised $24.1 billion in the first half of 2023, which breaks down to $17.2 billion in Q1 and $6.9 billion in Q2, per the latest PitchBook data. That\u2019s a big deal \u2014 but it\u2019s important to note that startups with all-women founding teams are still struggling to raise money this year.\nRipple\u2019s XRP case and the lack of regulatory clarity: Last week, the crypto community celebrated a U.S. federal court case that ruled Ripple\u2019s XRP token does not make up illegal securities sales \u2014 but only in some cases.

Want it in your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here.\nToday I\u2019m looking at a recent acquisition that shows the drive toward more resilient APIs. Also this week, a recent round that adds nuance to the market for substance abuse therapy startups. \u2014 Anna\nResilient APIs\nCreating and distributing APIs might soon be easier: Speakeasy, an early-stage startup, is working on it.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve started by working on an important problem to me, one that I\u2019ve faced a lot myself as a developer, which is really dramatically simplifying how developers are able to ship APIs to end users,\u201d its CEO Sagar Batchu told TechCrunch\u2019s Ron Miller.\n\nSpeakeasy is using AI to automate API creation and distribution\n\nHowever, large companies with over 5,000 developers already struggle with API sprawl, according to a survey supporting API platform Postman\u2019s 2023 State of the API Report. Thirty-one percent of respondents at these large companies mentioned \u201cmanaging too many APIs or microservices\u201d as an obstacle to producing APIs, compared with just 23% of all survey-takers.\nIt\u2019s not hard to see how this finding connects to Postman\u2019s recently announced acquisition and upcoming integration of API observability startup \u200b\u200bAkita Software. \u201cAkita\u2019s addition will make it easier than ever for users to manage their production APIs, even in the face of API sprawl,\u201d its press release states.\nAccording to Akita founder Jean Yang, the rise of APIs has fundamentally changed the software development process. \u201cMore and more testing has moved to production. Intended behavior is now based on observed behavior. More and more, the only way for teams to figure out even what\u2019s running is by inspecting production. We need new tools that meet developers where they are: not just for building the first draft of software, but for debugging, maintenance, and the nth draft,\u201d she wrote in her announcement.\nOn a related note, chaos engineering might no longer be the sole domain of site reliability engineers.\n",

        "content": "Startups that look to improve an industry\u2019s outdated infrastructure are definitely welcome in sectors like financial services and healthcare. But why would a company build infrastructure for an industry that seems to have hit its prime and zoomed past it in record time?\nThat was my question when I saw the news about Futureverse\u2019s recent $54 million Series A round. The startup is a platform of 11 companies that range from gaming studios and entities that enable web3 payments, to blockchain startups providing the tools for brands and builders to more easily create content for the metaverse.\nI\u2019m missing something. Aren\u2019t we all tired of hearing about the metaverse against our will? Haven\u2019t we come to the realization that folks don\u2019t want their social or work lives to look anything like Second Life?\nAaron McDonald, co-founder and CEO of Futureverse, told TechCrunch+ that some of the more vocal players in the category have made the metaverse seem like it\u2019s one thing \u2014\u00a0a virtual world \u2014 as opposed to what he sees it as: technology that could create a virtual world and also power a lot of other things.\nFor McDonald, it\u2019s not dissimilar to how we think about the internet today compared to when the term was first coined \u2014 it\u2019s no longer a thing, but rather the thing that powers applications and websites. In line with that frame of thinking, Futureverse defines the metaverse as the collection of interoperable applications built on top of user data.\nEssentially, the Futureverse is looking to help people build more encompassing experiences where the users don\u2019t realize it\u2019s run on the blockchain or utilizes NFTs, McDonald said.\nOne example of this is a game Futureverse launched with FIFA for the Women\u2019s World Cup. Users coach a team of automated players in an immersive world, but they aren\u2019t made aware of the fact that it is run on web3 and utilizes NFTs. To most users, then, it is just a game.",

Shenzhen-based startup Botinkit has brought its cooking robots beyond China\u2019s borders to Japan and the U.S., and now will use the $13 million it raised in a Series A to bring its culinary creators to Europe and the Middle East.\nBeyond cutting back on the loss of ingredients and energy usage during the cooking process, Botinkit sees another benefit to its robots.\n\u201cCuisine used to be restricted by time and geographical boundaries. However, with the digitization of cooking, a range of new possibilities arise, including remote cooking. Suppose I\u2019m in Shenzhen and you\u2019re in the U.S., I can use our software and hardware system to \u2018cook\u2019 for you remotely,\u201d co-founder Shirley Chen told TechCrunch earlier this week.\nSoftBank utilizes Rice Robotics\u2019 deliveries\nWorkers in SoftBank\u2019s new Tokyo headquarters have been using delivery robots with wide, adorable eyes to ferry 7-Eleven orders between the stores and drop-off locations. The cartoonish couriers, made by Hong Kong-based Rice Robotics, can run for 12 hours and just take an hour to recharge between onigiri and UCC coffee runs.\nRecognition from SoftBank and other customers has convinced several investors to back Rice\u2019s latest $7 million pre-Series A funding round, which will be put toward a continued expansion within Japan, the company\u2019s No. 1 source of revenue.\nForwardX\u2019s robotics efforts hit $140M in fundraising\nWarehouse logistics and inventory management have been discussed in past editions, and for good reason \u2014 it\u2019s a huge industry ripe with opportunity for robotics and automation. And ForwardX, based in Beijing, has been collecting a significant amount of investment since launching in 2016.\nThe company, which has already dispatched 3,000 robots across a client list that includes IKEA, UNIQLO, Walmart and Mitsubishi, just announced a $30 million fundraise that brings its Series C to $61 million and its total funding to $140 million.\nWomen in Robotics launches a scholarship in honor of Joanne Pransky\nJoanne Pransky, who recently passed away following decades of work within the robotics industry, left an indelible mark on the space as she sought to spur an understanding of the human side of our relationships with robots.\nThe nonprofit Women in Robotics is looking to honor her legacy by helping the next wave of women and non-binary students with a scholarship that takes her namesake. Anyone can help contribute to the fund right here via Bold.org.\n\u201cAs a pioneer in the field of social robotics and the sales and marketing of robots and robotics journals, Joanne was very often the only woman in the room,\u201d Women in Robotics president Andra Keay told TechCrunch. And with the help of the Joanne Pransky Celebration of Women in Robotics scholarship, that will be a thing of the past.\n\nWant the top robotics news in your inbox each week?

        "title": "This week in AI: Companies voluntarily submit to AI guidelines \u2014 for now",
        "content": "Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as\u00a0AI\u00a0is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you, here\u2019s a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning, along with notable research and experiments we didn\u2019t cover on their own.\nThis week in AI, we saw OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon voluntarily commit to pursuing shared AI safety and transparency goals ahead of a planned executive order from the Biden administration.\nAs my colleague Devin Coldewey writes, there\u2019s no rule or enforcement being proposed, here \u2014 the practices agreed to are purely voluntary. But the pledges indicate, in broad strokes, the AI regulatory approaches and policies that each vendor might find amendable in the U.S. as well as abroad.\nAmong other commitments, the companies volunteered to conduct security tests of AI systems before release, share information on AI mitigation techniques and develop watermarking techniques that make AI-generated content easier to identify. They also said that they would invest in cybersecurity to protect private AI data and facilitate the reporting of vulnerabilities, as well as prioritize research on societal risks like systemic bias and privacy issues.\nThe commitments are important step, to be sure \u2014 even if they\u2019re not enforceable. But one wonders if there are ulterior motives on the part of the undersigners.\n\nTop AI companies visit the White House to make \u2018voluntary\u2019 safety commitments\n\nReportedly, OpenAI drafted an internal policy memo that shows the company supports the idea of requiring government licenses from anyone who wants to develop AI systems. CEO Sam Altman first raised the idea at a U.S. Senate hearing in May, during which he backed the creation of an agency that could issue licenses for AI products \u2014 and revoke them should anyone violate set rules.\nIn a recent interview with press, Anna Makanju, OpenAI\u2019s VP of global affairs, insisted that OpenAI wasn\u2019t \u201cpushing\u201d for licenses and that the company only supports licensing regimes for AI models more powerful than OpenAI\u2019s current GPT-4. But government-issued licenses, should they be implemented in the way that OpenAI proposes, set the stage for a potential clash with startups and open source developers who may see them as an attempt to make it more difficult for others to break into the space.\nDevin said it best, I think, when he described it to me as \u201cdropping nails on the road behind them in a race.\u201d At the very least, it illustrates the two-faced nature of AI companies who seek to placate regulators while shaping policy to their favor (in this case putting small challengers at a disadvantage) behind the scenes.\nIt\u2019s a worrisome state of affairs. But if policymakers step up to the plate, there\u2019s hope yet for sufficient safeguards without undue interference from the private sector.\nHere are other AI stories of note from the past few days:\n\nOpenAI\u2019s trust and safety head steps down: Dave Willner, an industry veteran who was OpenAI\u2019s head of trust and safety, announced in a post on LinkedIn that he\u2019s left the job and transitioned to an advisory role. OpenAI said in a statement that it\u2019s seeking a replacement and that CTO Mira Murati will manage the team on an interim basis.\nCustomized instructions for ChatGPT: In more OpenAI news, the company has\u00a0launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users so that they don\u2019t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.\nGoogle news-writing AI: Google is testing a tool that uses AI to write news stories and has started demoing it to publications, according to\u00a0a new report from The New York Times. The tech giant has pitched the AI system to The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal\u2019s owner, News Corp.\nApple tests a ChatGPT-like chatbot: Apple is developing AI to challenge OpenAI, Google and others, according to a new report from Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman. Specifically, the tech giant has created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as \u201cApple GPT.\u201d\nMeta releases Llama 2: Meta unveiled a new family of AI models, Llama 2, designed to drive apps along the lines of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT,\u00a0Bing Chat and other modern chatbots. Trained on a mix of publicly available data, Meta claims that Llama 2\u2019s performance has improved significantly over the previous generation of Llama models.\nAuthors protest against generative AI: Generative AI systems like ChatGPT are trained on publicly available data, including books \u2014 and not all content creators are pleased with the arrangement. In an open letter signed by more than 8,500 authors of fiction, nonfiction and poetry, the tech companies behind large language models like\u00a0ChatGPT, Bard, LLaMa and more are taken to task for using their writing without permission or compensation.\nMicrosoft brings Bing Chat to the enterprise: At its annual Inspire conference, Microsoft announced Bing Chat Enterprise, a version of its Bing Chat AI-powered chatbot with business-focused data privacy and governance controls. With Bing Chat Enterprise, chat data isn\u2019t saved, Microsoft can\u2019t view a customer\u2019s employee or business data and customer data isn\u2019t used to train the underlying AI models.\n\nMore machine learnings\nTechnically this was also a news item, but it bears mentioning here in the research section. Fable Studios, which previously made CG and 3D short films for VR and other media, showed off an AI model it calls Showrunner that (it claims) can write, direct, act in and edit an entire TV show \u2014 in their demo, it was \u201cSouth Park.\u201d\n\nMaybe showing off an AI-generated fake TV episode during a writers\u2019 strike is a bad idea\n\nI\u2019m of two minds on this. On one hand, I think pursuing this at all, let alone during a huge Hollywood strike that involves issues of compensation and AI, is in rather poor taste. Though CEO Edward Saatchi said he believes that the tool puts power in the hands of creators, the opposite is also arguable. At any rate it was not received particularly well by people in the industry.\nOn the other hand, if someone on the creative side (which Saatchi is) does not explore and demonstrate these capabilities, then they will be explored and demonstrated by others with less compunction about putting them to use. Even if the claims Fable makes are a bit expansive for what they actually showed (which has serious limitations), it is like the original DALL-E in that it prompted discussion and indeed worry, even though it was no replacement for a real artist. AI is going to have a place in media production one way or another \u2014 but for a whole sack of reasons it should be approached with caution.\nOn the policy side, a little while back we had the National Defense Authorization Act going through with (as usual) some really ridiculous policy amendments that have nothing to do with defense. But among them was one addition that the government must host an event where researchers and companies can do their best to detect AI-generated content. This kind of thing is definitely approaching \u201cnational crisis\u201d levels, so it\u2019s probably good this got slipped in there.\n\nOver at Disney Research, they\u2019re always trying to find a way to bridge the digital and the real \u2014 for park purposes, presumably. In this case they have developed a way to map virtual movements of a character or motion capture (say for a CG dog in a film) onto an actual robot, even if that robot is a different shape or size. It relies on two optimization systems, each informing the other of what is ideal and what is possible, sort of like a little ego and superego. This should make it much easier to make robot dogs act like regular dogs, but of course it\u2019s generalizable to other stuff as well.\nAnd here\u2019s hoping AI can help us steer the world away from sea-bottom mining for minerals, because that is definitely a bad idea. A multi-institutional study put AI\u2019s ability to sift signal from noise to work predicting the location of valuable minerals around the globe. As they write in the abstract:\nIn this work, we embrace the complexity and inherent \u201cmessiness\u201d of our planet\u2019s intertwined geological, chemical, and biological systems by employing machine learning to characterize patterns embedded in the multidimensionality of mineral occurrence and associations.\nThe study actually predicted and verified locations of uranium, lithium, and other valuable minerals. And how about this for a closing line: The system \u201cwill enhance our understanding of mineralization and mineralizing environments on Earth, across our solar system, and through deep time.\u201d Awesome.\n",

        "title": "Tech warriors in the battle for Israel\u2019s democracy",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nErel Margalit\nContributor\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n \n\n\n\n\nErel Margalit is an Israeli high-tech investor, social entrepreneur, and former Knesset member. He is the founder and Executive Chairman of the Jerusalem-based VC firm Jerusalem Venture Partners, and Margalit Startup City, the international collection of thematic socioeconomic hubs.\t\n\nIsrael is a country that has battled for its existence and survival since Day 1.\nHaving fought multiple wars and living with ongoing threats, Israelis are now in a fierce battle for their democracy. This battle is not fought with tanks or guns but with the power of unity, protest, and the determination to protect the very essence of their nation.\nLast week, hundreds of thousands poured onto the streets across the country in response to the Netanyahu government\u2019s passage, and in a first Knesset reading, of the \u201creasonableness bill,\u201d which will severely restrict judicial review of decisions made by the cabinet, government ministers, and other elected officials.\nThe bill is part of a contentious legislative package advanced by the hardline Netanyahu coalition that aims to radically overhaul Israel\u2019s independent judiciary and curb checks and balances on political power. This week, the government plans to bring the bill for its final votes.\nAnd our unequivocal answer is, \u201cNO.\u201d\nWe at JVP and the entire Israeli high-tech sector, whose members went out in droves to protest, alongside doctors, teachers, members of the military reserves, pilots, special forces units, and people from all walks of life, are saying no to dictatorship and yes to democracy.\n \n\n\t\t\tOften, in the history of countries, there are key moments of real, existential crisis that demand answers on values.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nIn addition to their contributions to Israel\u2019s economy, the tech community recognizes the vital role that democracy and societal openness play in fostering innovation, invention, and creativity. These values are the very foundation of the national spirit that drives the country\u2019s success on the global stage. As a result, the high-tech sector has joined forces with other industries to stand united in the defense of democratic principles that have allowed Israel to flourish.\nWe refuse to let our hard-fought freedoms be undermined by a government seeking to consolidate power and erode the principles that have made Israel a beacon of democracy in the region.\nWhat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has found in many of us are warriors. Just like we have been warriors on the front lines, we are also warriors in this battle for democracy. We understand that the strength of a nation lies not only in its military might but also in its commitment to upholding the values of justice, equality, and freedom. We will not stand idly by as these values are threatened.\nWith last week\u2019s mass demonstrations and more protests planned this week, Israelis from the center, the left, and the moderate right convey a powerful message to Netanyahu and his far-right partners: The judicial overhaul he and they are trying to lead is unacceptable and will not be allowed to pass. We refuse to let Israel slide down the dangerous path of illiberal governance witnessed in countries like Poland and Hungary. Our country\u2019s strength lies in its vibrant democracy, where the rule of law prevails and every citizen\u2019s rights are protected.\nIn a country with such strong societal bonds and with so many people who have sacrificed and paid heavy prices, we can\u2019t let this government hijack the judicial system and transform Israel from a proud, hard-earned liberal democracy into something we no longer recognize.\nFor Israelis, democracy and societal openness are the very fundamental conditions of innovation, invention, and creativity. It is our national spirit.\nThe collective determination to defend democratic principles reflects the deep societal bonds and the belief that preserving democracy is vital for the continued success and prosperity of the nation.\nTechnology and innovation \u2014 for JVP and many in the high-tech sector and other industries \u2014 have been instrumental in fostering cooperation and partnerships with other tech and business ecosystems, not just in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, but also in the Middle East. Countries like the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan have become allies in the pursuit of technological progress and economic growth.\nWe cannot let everything we built be destroyed by a government intent on harming Israel\u2019s independent judiciary, a cornerstone of every democracy. The high-tech sector, along with various other industries, stands united in its commitment to safeguard the democratic values that have propelled Israel\u2019s success on the global stage.\nJust as they have been warriors on the front lines of technological advancement, they are now warriors in the fight to protect their nation\u2019s democratic soul. The determination to overcome this existential crisis and uphold the core values that define Israel\u2019s identity and strength is a testament to the resilience and unity of the Israeli people. This pivotal moment calls for a resolute stance on the values that have shaped the country\u2019s history, and it is one that will shape its future.\nWe are going to overcome this, and the people who are trying to derail democracy today will be gone tomorrow. Often, in the history of countries, there are key moments of real, existential crisis that demand answers on values.\nFor Israel, this is one of those moments.\n",

If it\u2019s anywhere as popular as the iPhone version, expect to see some big numbers over the next few weeks.\nOf course any mobile user can access ChatGPT or other OpenAI tools via the web interface, but the superior experience of a dedicated app has proven extremely compelling, to put it lightly. iPhone users downloaded it half a million times in the first week, impressing everyone until Threads came along and blew it out of the water.\nThe ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version\u2019s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too \u2014 so if you\u2019re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.\nOf course it won\u2019t be completely identical, since the two mobile operating systems differ in many ways. For instance, the June additions of Siri and Shortcuts to the app on iOS clearly won\u2019t be making the transition, but it\u2019s likely Android users will get something similar.\nOn Twitter, OpenAI said that the Android app would be \u201crolling out to users next week,\u201d presumably in the U.S. first. No plans were mentioned for other countries, but it\u2019s likely that they\u2019ll follow after a few weeks or months.

        "title": "Bolt, ex-CEO Ryan Breslow subject of SEC probe",
        "content": "Ryan Breslow, co-founder of the e-commerce software outfit Bolt, was subpoenaed along with the company last year by the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission. The Information reported the news first on Friday.\nA letter authored in April by a lawyer representing Bolt investors said the SEC was investigating whether federal securities laws were violated in connection with statements made when Bolt was raising money in 2021. The letter was sent to Bolt\u2019s general counsel as part of a demand to inspect the company\u2019s records on behalf of two Bolt investors, Brian Reinken of WestCap Management and Arjun Sethi of Tribe Capital Management, who were Series C and B investors, respectively.\nPer the letter referenced by The Information, it was alleged that Breslow \u201cmisled\u201d investors while fundraising for the company\u2019s $355 million Series E round, valuing the company at $11 billion. The attorney representing WestCap and Tribe Capital wrote that Breslow \u201cmade material misrepresentations about the Company\u2019s financial condition and product pipeline that resulted in the Series E investors buying into the Company at a grossly inflated valuation.\u201d\n\nFresh round of $355M lifts online checkout company Bolt into decacorn territory\n\nShortly after that Series E financing was announced in January 2022, Breslow made headlines in both positive and negative ways related to comments he made about competitors and investors, and ended up stepping down as Bolt\u2019s CEO. Soon after, he launched a wellness marketplace called Love that, according to his LinkedIn profile, he founded in January 2022.\nAsked about the subpoena and lawsuit, an SEC spokesperson tells TechCrunch that the agency \u201cdoes not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.\u201d\nIn a separate matter, a lawsuit filed this week against Breslow by former board member Activant Ventures\u2019 Steve Sarracino alleges that Breslow removed him and two other board members when they declined to help Breslow repay a $30 million loan. Sarracino\u2019s suit also alleges that CEO Maju Kuruvilla and three board members appointed afterward did not force Breslow to make loan repayments.\nWhen reached for comment, Breslow did not respond personally, but brought in a Bolt spokesperson who acknowledged the lawsuit regarding the loan, writing via email that, \u201cBolt is not the direct target of this litigation, and we continue to seek resolution of the outstanding amount. We remain well-capitalized and the existence of this outstanding obligation to the company does not and will not affect our day-to-day operations or prospects.\u201d\nAt the time that Bolt announced its Series E funding, the company was a hot commodity.\n\nFintech Bolt just laid off over 100 employees across engineering, sales and marketing\n\nSpeaking about taking in $355 million, Breslow told TechCrunch at the time, \u201cIt may seem like a lot of money raised, but actually no, this is capital for us to be competitive. We don\u2019t just want to be on par with competitors, but be better. The capital will enable us to bring in the best talent, make strategic acquisitions and expand into Europe, which is important to us.\u201d\nThough Bolt was having no trouble at that moment bringing in large amounts of capital, Breslow has been public about his struggles to attract Silicon Valley investors early-on. It was right after the Series E that he began publishing those thoughts on Twitter.\nIt wasn\u2019t long after that he stepped down as CEO, insisting that his resignation was not tied to the attention his tweets attracted.\nSoon after, it seemed like things continued to be like riding a rollercoaster for Bolt. The company was sued by one of its biggest customers in May 2022 (the case was settled months later). The next day, TechCrunch reported about a blog post CEO Maju Kuruvilla wrote that revealed a 131% year-over-year increase in shopper accounts, and a 192% YoY increase in total active merchant accounts.\nThen just a few weeks later, Bolt laid off over 100 people in a restructuring move that Kuruvilla, again via blog post, attributed to shifting market conditions, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that the market conditions across our industry and the tech sector are changing, and against the macro challenges, we\u2019ve been taking measures to adapt our business. In an effort to ensure Bolt owns its own destiny, the leadership team and I have made the decision to secure our financial position, extend our runway, and reach profitability with the money we have already raised.\u201d\nFollowing the Series E, The New York Times reported that Bolt\u2019s leadership began another round of talks with investors to go after additional capital at a higher valuation of $14 billion; however, that has not yet materialized.\n\nFor fintechs in 2022, the bigger the exit, the larger the decline in value\n\n",

        "title": "Foreign visitors to China can finally go cashless like locals",
        "content": "Great news for those traveling to China! You can finally enjoy the seamless, cashless payment experience that you may have heard about for years and avoid the awkward interaction of asking your local friends to pay and giving them paper money that they can\u2019t spend anywhere.\nThis week, China\u2019s two dominant mobile payment solutions, WeChat Pay and Alipay, announced that foreign users can now pay at Chinese retailers by linking their foreign credit cards, including Visa, Mastercard and Discover.\nPreviously, using WeChat Pay and Alipay in China required a local bank account, making it challenging for short-term visitors to use these payment methods. While paying has become breezier for those living in China, finding places that accept cash is now a headache for foreign visitors, as the two payments giants have largely replaced cash from metropoles to villages despite the government\u2019s efforts to warn merchants against rejecting cash.\nThe development is thus a huge improvement in foreign visitors\u2019 experience in China. Given Alipay and WeChat Pay are literally ubiquitous in both China\u2019s online and offline retail spheres, foreign visitors may now be able to hail a Didi car, ride the subway, rent a shared bike, buy fruit from a grocer, order food delivery and even shop online for myriad Chinese e-commerce goods.\nWeChat\u2019s announcement provides useful details on what the setup looks like. To activate their WeChat wallets, foreign users will need to authenticate their identity by uploading their passports. Foreign phone numbers can be used for receiving verification codes.\nUnfortunately, visitors won\u2019t be able to try out the digitized Chinese hongbao custom, which involves sending or receiving digital versions of auspicious red envelopes filled with money. This feature was originally what drove WeChat\u2019s early wave of mass adoption. Visitors also can\u2019t conduct money transfers, which is unsurprising given China\u2019s stringent control of capital flows across borders.\nOn WeChat, spending limits per transaction, month and year for foreign visitors are 6,000 yuan (around $835), 50,000 yuan and 60,000 yuan, respectively. Transaction fees are waived for payments under 200 yuan (around $28), and any amount above that charges a 3% fee. Exchange rates are based on the rates of the card organization and the issuing bank.\u00a0\nThe payments giants previously had plans to integrate with international bank cards, but those didn\u2019t materialize. Hopefully, the regulatory approvals and infrastructure are ready this time. We will report back once we\u2019ve tried it out on the ground.\n\nChina\u2019s central bank digital currency takes a bigger place on WeChat\u2019s platform\n\n",

        "title": "Threads in decline? Don\u2019t count out Instagram\u2019s new Twitter rival yet",
        "content": "A Wall Street Journal article on Friday warns that Instagram\u2019s new Twitter competitor Threads is already losing steam. Citing third-party data from Sensor Tower, the paper reports the number of daily active users on Threads dropped for the second week down to 13 million, a 70% decline from a July 7 high point. By comparison, Twitter\u2019s daily active users are around 200 million. Despite this seemingly worrying trend, it\u2019s far too soon to count Threads out yet. By other metrics, the app is continuing to grow its user base and traction in global markets, which, in time, could also boost its usage \u2014 especially as the app\u2019s feature set improves.\nIt\u2019s expected that a highly anticipated new app would have stellar usage numbers in its early days as users set up their accounts, find and follow friends, and test out the app\u2019s capabilities. As the newness wears off, it\u2019s also typical to see usage numbers drop as users return to their old habits while determining if and how they\u2019ll continue to fit the new app into their daily routines. Plus, The WSJ points out, Meta executives said they planned for an eventual decline and don\u2019t see this usage drop as worrisome.\nWe don\u2019t either. Threads is still too new and too incomplete to make any sort of determination yet on its eventual fate. Could it be an early record-breaker that eventually flops? Sure. But it could also be a legitimate Twitter killer or mid-level success. It\u2019s just too early to tell.\nLaunched on July 5 to global markets, excluding the EU, Threads topped 100 million users within days of its arrival \u2014 becoming the fastest app to achieve that milestone, ahead of Pok\u00e9mon GO, according to app intelligence firm data.ai. During its first three days, it had 18.3% of the daily active users of Twitter, or 54.4 million to Twitter\u2019s 298 million. By last week, data.ai estimated the app still had roughly one-fifth of the weekly active user base of Twitter.\nImage Credits: data.ai\nApp installs for Threads peaked on July 9, a few days after its launch, when 24.5 million people downloaded the app globally across iOS and Android, data.ai says. But though the initial buzz may be wearing off, the app has continued to clock in north of 1 million new downloads daily over the past several days, ranging from 1.76 million on July 16 to 1.06 million on July 20, for example. Any new app on the market would be thrilled to see numbers like these, though perhaps Threads should be judged more harshly because it has the advantage of the network effects delivered by the nature of its parent app Instagram and the broader resources of Meta.\nData.ai estimates the app has now seen 185.32 million cumulative global downloads.\nImage Credits: data.ai\nImage Credits: data.ai\nAnother key point to note is that Threads is catching on in emerging mobile markets where downloads are still growing. The U.S. is only its third-largest market, data.ai\u2019s analysis shows. As of July 17, India and Brazil accounted for a larger number of installs, at 60.1 million (32.6%) and 40.2 million (21.8%), respectively. The U.S. delivered 27.8 million downloads or 15.1%. That\u2019s why analytics firm Similarweb\u2019s analysis of U.S. Android usage declines \u2014 21 minutes on July 7 to 6 minutes on July 14 \u2014 aren\u2019t able to tell the whole story.\nThough Threads usage may have declined for now, as Sensor Tower data shows, its early usage numbers demonstrated its potential as a Twitter rival. In its first few days on the market, Threads users were spending 15 minutes on average per day on the app, across 9.4 app sessions. That\u2019s more than the \u201cmicroblogging\u201d category averages, which data.ai says includes Twitter, Truth Social, Mastodon and Bluesky. Microblogging users then spent 12.5 minutes per day, on average, across 7.8 app sessions.\nWhat\u2019s stopping people from using Threads more as of late may not be disappointment with the concept of the app itself but rather its current feature set, as compared with Twitter. Threads, though now publicly available, is effectively still a beta \u2014 an unfinished app \u2014 without a number of the features users want in a microblogging tool, like a chronological timeline, following feed, the ability to view your likes, a fully functional web version, an edit button, support for multiple accounts and more. These features are still in the works, along with Threads\u2019 planned integration with ActivityPub, the protocol powering open source Twitter alternative Mastodon.\nIn one thread on Threads (ha), in fact, users rushed to defend the app against the narrative that the app was dead, remarking that people should be more patient and wait for the needed features, and reminding others that even Instagram wasn\u2019t an overnight success.\nAnother post, led by social media consultant Matt Navarra, asked \u201cthreads is\u2026\u201d To this, Instagram head Adam Mosseri replied \u201ca work in progress.\u201d Across hundreds of other replies, many posted positive messages, calling the app an \u201copportunity,\u201d better than Twitter, an \u201cinspiration,\u201d \u201cexciting\u201d and more \u2014 an indication that Threads is already building a community of fans.\nAnother indication is the app\u2019s U.S. App Store rating, a 3.8-star rating across 20,000 reviews. Diving into where it\u2019s losing points, it seems many of those downrating the app are doing so due to its incomplete nature, calling it a \u201cpromising start\u201d but removing stars for its lack of certain features. By comparison, Instagram has a 4.7-star rating and Facebook has a 2.3. Another thing Threads has in its favor, based on these reviews and other online conversations, is that the app, for now, feels \u201cless toxic\u201d than Twitter, several users have remarked.\nWhile Twitter users are already dancing on Threads\u2019 grave, thanks to The WSJ report, the reality is that it\u2019s too early to report on Threads\u2019 week two usage declines and come to the conclusion that Threads is dying. An app that breaks records out of the gate and continues to add users still has plenty of runway ahead and has time to deliver on the features people want, in order to regain traction.\nEven seven-year-old Mastodon, the decentralized social networking Twitter rival, is continuing to grow in the wake of Elon Musk\u2019s missteps with Twitter. After Twitter\u2019s acquisition, Mastodon peaked at 2.5 million monthly active users. When Threads, launched, Mastodon had fallen to 1.7 million monthly users. It has since begun to grow again, now seeing 2.1 million monthly active users. These things ebb and flow.\nThere\u2019s also an online culture that\u2019s more willing to experiment with new apps \u2014 whether that\u2019s Twitter alternatives like Threads and Bluesky, Reddit alternatives like Lemmy and Kbin, or new ways to network like TikTok instead of old-fashioned Facebook.\nPlus, for Threads to succeed, Twitter doesn\u2019t have to completely fail. Users can pick and choose between them or they can use both. It\u2019s not necessarily a zero-sum game.\nThat said, Meta doesn\u2019t have a great track record for launching successful new apps having shuttered nearly everything it built (instead of simply acquiring) over the years. Threads could one day become another app added to its graveyard.\nBut in the meantime, an app with now an estimated 116 million users and growing is far from being \u201cdead.\u201d\nImage Credits: Quiver Quant\n\nMark Zuckerberg touts Threads is seeing \u2018tens of millions\u2019 people return to the app daily\n\n",

Of the $2.4 billion invested in insurtech startups across the world, half, or $1.2 billion, went to American companies, per data from Dealroom. Regional results, therefore, deserve more of our attention.\nSo this morning, we\u2019re looking at how insurtech has been doing in the EU. We\u2019ll also check on the performance of several European insurtech startups, per data collected by Stanislas Lot, an investor at Daphni. To work!\nWhere does Europe stand?\nThe U.S. insurtech market is the single largest in the world for venture investment, which isn\u2019t surprising since it is the world\u2019s largest venture market.

That decline is actually steeper than what we\u2019ve seen around the world (a 23% fall), in the United States (22% lower) and Southeast Asia (down 5%).

        "title": "Suspending access to medication abortions will threaten telehealth access",
        "content": "\n\n\n\nDana Northcraft\nContributor\n\n\n\n\nShare on Twitter\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\tDana Northcraft, the founding director of Reproductive Health Initiative for Telehealth Equity & Solutions (RHITES), is a digital health legal and policy specialist with more than 20 years of experience in law, advocacy, and coalition building.\t\n\nTelehealth has revolutionized the way healthcare services are delivered, becoming an increasingly popular means of providing remote medical care to patients. This was particularly true throughout the COVID-19 pandemic when telehealth was a crucial part of combating a public health crisis.\nWe are now facing another public health crisis: the ongoing erosion of access to abortion in a post-Roe world and the resulting impact to our health systems. While many people don\u2019t know it, telehealth can once again be part of the solution.\nHowever, frivolous lawsuits led by extremists, including the recent federal court decision out of Texas ordering the national ban of mifepristone (the first of two medications used in the FDA-approved regimen for medication abortion care), threaten this very safe and effective abortion method.\nIn the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, expanding telehealth access to abortion is essential to helping people get the care they need. As someone who has worked extensively on solutions for expanding reproductive health access, I know that telehealth is perfectly suited for abortion care.\n\n\n\t\t\tAs someone who has worked extensively on solutions for expanding reproductive health access, I know that telehealth is perfectly suited for abortion care.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nNot only has it been shown to be just as safe and effective as in-person care, it also reduces waiting times, increases privacy, and can reach patients in remote and rural areas \u2014 things that have always been needed for abortion provision and are even more important today.\nRecent data from #WeCount show that telehealth has played an increasingly crucial role in meeting the needs of those seeking abortions since Roe was struck down. Telehealth abortion provided by virtual-only clinics increased by 137% in the six months following the Dobbs decision.\nIf you consider the providers who work in brick-and-mortar clinics who also offer telehealth services, the numbers become even more impactful. It is important to note that while telehealth has increasingly become a linchpin in the ability to access abortion, there are still tens of thousands of people being denied abortion care.\nRight now, abortion is banned or severely restricted in nearly half the states, leaving large portions of the country without an abortion provider who can even give an in-person consultation.\nAbortion is a time-sensitive procedure. This is especially true for medication abortion care, which is safe and effective in terminating a pregnancy up to the first 10 to 12 weeks. Finding the means to travel across the state, let alone across state lines, can lead to delays and push this care out of reach, especially for BIPOC populations or those struggling to make ends meet.\nLike with other healthcare, video conferencing or phone consultations have the potential to obliterate these barriers, enabling providers to screen and counsel patients, remotely prescribe medication, and have it delivered to the patient\u2019s home.\nTelehealth has expanded the ability of healthcare to reach more and more people. The privacy it affords patients can also reduce the stigma and shame people feel when accessing healthcare.\nWhile this is especially important for those who live in areas where they may be concerned about facing judgment, receiving confidential medical attention in a private space of our choosing is something that everyone can benefit from.\nBut when we say \u201ceveryone,\u201d we must truly mean everyone. Those who have been and will continue to be most impacted by restrictions on abortion care are the same as those who encounter racism, poverty, and the myriad social determinants of health that negatively impact the lives of people of color and those struggling to make ends meet.\nWe have an opportunity to center equity in healthcare solutions. Bans on medications like mifepristone will exacerbate inequities. When we talk about telehealth delivery of care, we must ensure it reaches communities that lack broadband and smartphone access and provide resources that address language needs and different levels of health literacy. We must center racial justice and provide culturally competent care.\nThe time is now to continue the expansion and availability of telehealth, including for abortion care, not to go backward. There is no doubt that we are in the midst of a crisis, but there is also no doubt that we can meet that crisis with innovative solutions.\nBy bringing advocates, providers, businesses, and innovators together, we can forge partnerships to expand healthcare, including the abortion care ecosystem.\n",

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.\nIt seems like the fizzle has gone out of the VR conversation altogether, as every manufacturer and conversation is refocusing its attention on AR. That wasn\u2019t particularly new, but Apple\u2019s flagship headset is a huge leap away from virtual reality, embracing the blended world more fully.\nApple didn\u2019t actually add much to the conversation so far \u2014 the headset hasn\u2019t started shipping yet, after all \u2014 but you\u2019d be a particularly spicy mixed blend of not-in-touch-with-reality spices to bet against the Cupertino giant these days. This represents a profound opportunity for startups.\nWill we find the humanity in AI?\nImage Credits: NanoStockk (opens in a new window) / Getty Images\nThere\u2019s an old joke: Bob says to his friend, peering into the infinite abyss of space: \u201cDo you think there\u2019s any intelligent life out there?\u201d Anna replies: \u201cWhy would there be \u2014 there\u2019s barely any down here.\u201d Funny, yes, but the punchline keeps rattling around in my mind as the AI train continues to hurtle along the track. See, I don\u2019t think artificial intelligence is inherently evil or good, but it has to be trained on something, and the best we\u2019ve got is a lot of human knowledge. Humans may not be inherently evil, but my goodness, we aren\u2019t particularly kind either.\nThis week, Devin notes that, in the midst of a writers\u2019 strike, it was insensitive timing at best when Fable Studios showed off an AI-generated, fake episode of \u201cSouth Park.\u201d\nApple (you know, that giant company based in Cupertino. They make earbuds and stuff) was also in the news for AI for a bit. Relevant to startups, it removed an AI-powered content generator impersonating Meta\u2019s Threads app. Less relevant to startups, but I imagine it\u2019ll make a startup or two twitch nervously, the company is reportedly testing a ChatGPT-like AI chatbot. Maybe Siri will finally grow some smarts \u2014 because right now, she\u2019s pretty astonishingly under par in the \u201csmarts\u201d department. I may rant about that a bit more in my column next week.\nI\u2019m not a Shein fan, honestly (essentially single-use clothing is so profoundly bad for the environment), but now there\u2019s another reason to have an issue with the clothing manufacturer: Designers are pissed about Shein ripping off their work using AI\u00a0and are suing the company.\nYou doodle it, Stability makes it good: You may have seen the \u201cdraw some circles, now draw the rest of the owl\u201d meme that has been floating around the internet forever. This week, Stability AI took that meme to a whole new level with its Stable Doodle, a sketch-to-image tool.\nBonjour, Bard: Google\u2019s Bard chatbot finally launches in the EU\u00a0and supports more than 40 languages. As you might expect, though, the EU is keeping a close eye on it, as privacy advocates are keeping watch.\nFare thee well, Joanne: Roboticist Joanne Pransky died recently\u00a0and has left a lasting impact on the industry, bringing a uniquely human element to conversations about robotics and automation. A much needed addition to the conversation, if you ask me.\nOff the chain . . .\nImage Credits: Bing Guan / Getty Images\n\u2026 or maybe the chain fell off. Fashion-forward bike company VanMoof met its demise this week, and we were left wondering how the popular e-bike pioneer could be pedaling toward bankruptcy last week, even as the market boomed. The company steered off the cliff this week with an official declaration of bankruptcy in The Netherlands.\nApropos transportation, Tesla announced that the first Cybertruck finally rolled off the manufacturing lines, years after it was promised. Tesla also announced one of the wilder things I\u2019ve heard in a hot minute \u2014 as someone who has been driving a FSD Tesla for a while, and turned the functionality off because I kept fearing for my life, it brought a proper belly laugh to learn that Tesla is planning to license its FSD tech to other OEMs soon. It\u2019ll be interesting to see what happens on both of those fronts, especially as the competition responds. Ford slashed its F-150 Lightning EV pickup prices, and the manufacturer goes heavy on the gas with its hands-off driving, as it releases BlueCruise 1.3.\nWhen payday goes negative: It seems like Tesla\u2019s director-level pay was a little excessive there for a moment, and they pay $735 million to settle claims they overpaid themselves.\nSure, it\u2019s the humans: I rarely go for a drive without muttering under my breath about drivers doing spectacularly dumb things, but Cruise and Waymo blaming humans and their bad driving skills for robotaxi permit delays seems a bit rich. That people are bad drivers ought to be the No. 1 most predictable thing ever, no? The safety regulators got their feathers in a tizzy over the company\u2019s ad, saying it was in poor taste to use accidents by human drivers as a sales tactic.\nWouldn\u2019t it be great if they didn\u2019t catch fire, tho?: Rebecca reports that NYC gig workers need help accessing safe e-bikes amid lithium battery fires.\nBig trends in startup land\nImage Credits: Haje Kamps (opens in a new window) / TechCrunch (opens in a new window)\nStartup layoffs have been in our headlines most of the year. Our Equity podcast mused that the tech startups might just be in the pruning phase at the moment.\nFundraising has gone up and down a bit over the past year, but one thing that has been the overarching theme is whether startups are able to get into profitability \u2014 or have a clear path to getting there, at least. That led Alex to analyze on TC+ whether software startups are actually good businesses.\nSpeaking of good businesses \u2014 it\u2019s pretty universally understood that \u201cShark Tank\u201d is entertainment and that there\u2019s a round of due diligence that happens after the cameras stop rolling. But Manish reports that \u201cShark Tank India\u201d investors fall short on pledges, which is grumpificating (yes, that\u2019s definitely a word) some participants of the show.\nTechCrunch+ spoke to a founder who decided to replace himself as CEO. It was a wonderfully frank and vulnerable conversation. You should read it. Although I\u2019m biased \u2014 I wrote the piece \u2014 it\u2019s a story that\u2019s rarely told about startups, and yet it\u2019s remarkably common.\nThere\u2019s been some fun exits in the past week. Here\u2019s a smattering of \u2019em.\nA fast exit: Amanda reports that Passes acquired Fanhouse, after what appears to have been about 24 hours\u2019 worth of negotiations, but some creators are apprehensive about the move.\nMilking it: Christine reports that infant formula company Bobbie raised $70 million, spending a chunk of the money to acquire its competitor Nature\u2019s One.\nMilking it some more: It\u2019s not often that a venture capital firm gets to back a startup again after it has exited \u2014 especially one that is still a private company; however, that\u2019s what happened with Performance Livestock Analytics (PLA) this week.\nTop reads on TechCrunch this week\nPew, pew, pew: Aria met the 19-year-old MIT dropout who\u2019s working on \u201creplacing gunpowder\u201d for the defense industry.\nNot a fan, then: Amanda reports that after about two and a half years as CEO, Ami Gan is leaving OnlyFans. Chief strategy and operations officer Keily Blair will take over as CEO.\u00a0\nI wix you would just build me a website already: Kyle writes that Wix\u2019s AI Site Generator tool, announced today, will let users describe their intent and generate a website complete with a homepage, inner pages, and text and images \u2014 as well as business-specific sections for events, bookings and more.\nAnd finally, I tried to buy an article on TechCrunch. I know, I write for TechCrunch, so that was a pretty weird thing to do, but I spent $800 on baiting some scammers. What I didn\u2019t expect was to stumble into a Fiverr-powered rat\u2019s nest of organized crime and scoundrels impersonating my colleagues.\n\nGet your TechCrunch fix IRL.

        "content": "Every time a woman monetizes the absurd, she\u2019s accused of making fetish content. It\u2019s a symptom of the anti-sex moral panic sweeping pop culture \u2014 and this time, it\u2019s coming for TikTok\u2019s NPC creators.\u00a0\nSnippets of these creators\u2019 livestreams keep going viral, and because the internet loves to hate on women, the nonsensical mannerisms that these creators use in their content has been written off as disturbing, cringe and definitely a sex thing. Sex workers, meanwhile, are unfairly dragged into dehumanizing conversations about the genre.\u00a0\nWhat onlookers actually seem to be mad about is the fact that these creators \u2014 most of whom are attractive young women \u2014 manage to profit off of being weird online.\u00a0\nThe phrase NPC, or \u201cnon-playable character,\u201d refers to video game characters whose personalities, dialogue and story lines cannot be controlled by the player. Instead, all interactions with NPCs are preset, which means the characters are limited to repeating their loops with little other substance. Online, particularly on TikTok, Reddit and 4chan, NPC is used as a derogatory term for people who aren\u2019t all there.\u00a0\n\n\n\ud83d\ude15 i\u2019ve never been more confused in my entire life dawg\u2026\u2026 pic.twitter.com/Y43gcySN1k\n\u2014 God\u2019s Child (@marlolifts) July 12, 2023\n\nNPC behavior is typically shallow and slightly uncanny. One TikTok creator described NPCs as lacking critical thinking, empathy and \u201cpassion and intrigue for higher concepts.\u201d If you tend to give canned answers and rarely deviate from your daily routine, you might be an NPC. In other words, you aren\u2019t the main character; at best, you fill in the background of someone else\u2019s life.\u00a0\nDespite the demeaning connotations, NPCs are having their moment in the spotlight. The once niche NPC livestreams are gaining popularity as a lucrative genre of content. In these streams, creators imitate the awkward, stiff movements typically seen in throwaway characters that didn\u2019t get enough design time. With neutral facial expressions and mesmerizing consistency, they sway back and forth, utter catchphrases in return for digital currency and above all, stay in character for hours at a time.\u00a0\nFedha Sinon, a TikTok creator known as PinkyDoll, became the face of the trend this month when clips of her livestreams went viral on Twitter. Her content perplexed viewers. She pops popcorn kernels with a hair straightener. She responds to gifts with repetitive phrases like \u201cmmm ice cream so good,\u201d \u201cgang gang\u201d or, for select viewers, \u201clove you!\u201d In one of her most popular bits, she pretends to pop balloons across the screen with hypnotizing cadence of a practiced ASMR artist.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s an NPC control kink,\u201d one Twitter user commented on a video of Sinon\u2019s stream. \u201cDon\u2019t look [too] much into it \u2026 I wish I didn\u2019t. Butttt basically they\u2019re controlling her like a video game character.\u201d\u00a0\nOthers accused her of \u201ccatering to pedos\u201d because she initially told viewers that she\u2019s 19 years old, not 27. One commentary creator described NPC TikTok as \u201cjust another gateway drug for getting boys hooked on fetish porn.\u201d Another Twitter user called Sinon an \u201cNPC sex doll for incels.\u201d\u00a0\nThe comments are degrading to both NPC TikTok creators and to sex workers. The sudden attention on NPC creators opened the door for bad faith discourse around online sex work, even though these TikTok creators aren\u2019t making this content for sexual gratification. Criticizing NPC livestreams as predatory kink content adds to the stigma surrounding sex work. Even if the content that NPC creators are making isn\u2019t explicitly sexual, the criticism targeting them is inherently linked to the anti-sex sentiments pervading online culture.\u00a0\n\u201cNPC is not a kink specifically for pedophiles. Let\u2019s be careful with our language,\u201d dominatrix and adult content creator Heaux House tweeted. \u201cThere are NPC creators that have existed before ppl found out about ole girl \u2026 Be sure to be very clear on what and who you\u2019re critiquing. Don\u2019t do that thing y\u2019all do where sex work(ers) get hit with your misinformed tweets.\u201d\u00a0\nTikTok livestream creators make money when their viewers send them gifts. Viewers can buy TikTok coins, and use those to purchase digital gifts, which each have their own monetary value; 65 coins cost about $1, 1,321 coins cost about $20 and 6,607 coins cost about $100. TikTok users can then spend the coins on a variety of gifts, which range from an ice cream cone (1 coin) to a balloon (300 coins.) Higher-ticket items include an octopus (10,000 coins), \u201cSam the whale\u201d (30,000 coins) and TikTok stars, which clock in at 39,999 coins.\u00a0\n\n\nthis was tweeted only 6 days ago now everyone on tiktok live is trying to be like her https://t.co/BqLd0psA0H\n\u2014 ari (@AriannaDantone) July 17, 2023\n\nGifts are converted to \u201cDiamonds,\u201d which creators can withdraw. TikTok takes a 50% cut, so an octopus, for example, will amount to 5,000 Diamonds for the creator, or about $75.\u00a0\nSinon, and the wave of creators joining in on the trend she started, unlocked the golden formula for monetizing livestreams. The weirder they act, the more people will stay to watch. The more people who send them money, the weirder they\u2019ll act. Creators with consistent viewership can rake it in if they\u2019re live for hours at a time.\u00a0\nSinon told Motherboard that she streams six hours a day, seven days a week. When she started, she made $250 per day. After going viral this month, she averages between $2,000 to $3,000 per stream, The New York Times reports. Across her social media accounts, including Instagram and OnlyFans, she makes around $7,000 per day.\u00a0\nDespite speculation from others online, NPC content isn\u2019t fetish content. Though Sinon and Cherry Crush, another popular live creator, also create content for OnlyFans, their TikTok streams are not sexually explicit. They don\u2019t wear revealing clothing. They aren\u2019t being compensated for providing sexual services. Although their NPC videos may drive curious viewers to their paywalled adult content, they don\u2019t promote their other accounts on their livestreams. They also don\u2019t incorporate NPC content into their NSFW platforms.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t make my show sexually suggestive at all,\u201d Cherry Crush told The New York Times. \u201cI always thought it was just funny & entertaining.\u201d\u00a0\nThere is a transactional nature to the content that Sinon and Cherry Crush make, and their appearance does influence their popularity. But being conventionally attractive and good at monetizing an audience does not make these creators predatory sex workers.\u00a0\nNPC TikTok creators are the latest to be accused of pushing fetish content onto vulnerable, impressionable minors. Other genres that are supposedly guilty of being vehicles for secret kinks include ASMR content, excessively messy food channels and viral crafting \u201chacks\u201d that might feature a woman\u2019s hands or feet. TikTok creators themselves have built followings by reacting to off-putting videos and judging whether or not the videos are secretly fetish content.\nThere is NSFW content that overlaps with these genres \u2014 the age-old Rule 34 asserts that if it exists, there\u2019s some kind of porn about it online. But that explicit content, which is produced with the intention of sexual gratification, can exist independently from the genre itself.\u00a0\nWriting off any weird behavior as kink content further demonizes sex work as predatory and shameful. Social media users tend to assume that content they don\u2019t immediately understand must be perverse, especially if it\u2019s presented by a young woman. We exist in an era of the internet that simultaneously sexualizes women who exist publicly, and yet is increasingly hostile toward sex work. Women have been targets of \u201cgrossness from creeps\u201d even if they aren\u2019t a \u201cfetish content creator,\u201d as Twitter user darshanaheena said.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten that exact same treatment just from blogging on tumblr,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI used to do occasional sponsored posts with swimwear on tumblr and guys would post my blog photos to fetish site discussion boards and they would all find my tumblr and leave me gross messages/replies. None of my content was sexual in nature, people are gross regardless.\u201d\u00a0\nThe possibility that fetish videos could be \u201chiding in plain sight\u201d on TikTok, an app that is just as popular with adults as it is with children, instills an unrelenting moral panic among those who aren\u2019t online themselves.\u00a0\nPurity culture is back with a vengeance, and the war on sex extends beyond political affiliation and generational divides. Boomers with Facebook accounts will find \u201cevidence\u201d of coded language for grooming in anything. Gen Z\u2019s \u201cpuriteens\u201d have been criticized for decrying common depictions of sexuality, like on-screen nudity between two consenting adult characters, as exploitative, predatory and problematic. Fandom culture, which once pioneered online sex positivity through fanfiction, is becoming more regressive by the day.\nIt all feeds the same narrative: sex is scary and coming for your children.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s almost easier to assume that a young woman who profits off of acting odd must be catering to some kind of sexual desire. The reality isn\u2019t that scandalous or particularly deep. Sometimes people just want to watch mindless, stimulating content from a pretty woman \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t make it secretly porn.\u00a0\n",

        "content": "AMC Theaters has announced that it\u2019s dropping plans to charge more for preferred seats and less for front-row ones through a tiered pricing system. The plan, called \u201cSightline,\u201d was being tested in three U.S. markets since March.\nThe company says it saw \u201clittle or no increase in patronage of front row seating, despite a modest price reduction for these seats,\u201d as people continued to sit in the preferred seats. More than 75% of AMC Stubs members who previously purchased tickets for preferred seats continued to select those seats, even with the slight upcharge applied.\nAMC also noted that its competitors did not try to match its pilot program, which is another reason why it\u2019s ending it, as it made the company less competitive in the test markets. The pilot program will come to an end at participating locations in the coming weeks, and the initiative will not roll out nationwide, AMC says.\u00a0\nAlthough this pilot program was not successful, AMC is going to try to find another way to fill the front rows of its theaters, which often go unsold.\n\u201cAMC is applying its learnings as it pivots to its next innovation \u2013 enhanced spacious front row seating with extensive seat recline,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post. \u201cBeginning in late 2023, AMC will begin testing its newest seating concept. Large, comfortable lounge style seating areas will allow guests to lay all the way back and relax. The angle of the seats will also make it more enjoyable to watch movies from these front row seats closest to the screen.\u201d\nAlthough AMC is planning to end the tiered pricing pilot program in the coming weeks, it remains in place for what is likely going to be the most popular weekend at theaters this year for moviegoers, as \u201cBarbie\u201d and \u201cOppenheimer\u201d debut today.\n",

        "title": "FedNow is finally live in the US",
        "content": "The U.S. government\u2019s instant payment system, FedNow Service, went live this week.\u00a0\nHere\u2019s a quick refresher on what that is: FedNow is an instant payment infrastructure for transferring money that promises to be a faster payment rail for financial institutions, offering immediate access to funds no matter the day or time. As you know, this is huge because banks aren\u2019t traditionally open 24/7 or let you receive money and use it on the same day.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s also something that the U.S. has been considered \u201cbehind\u201d on in light of the fact that other countries have been live with similar services for some time, including Brazil, India, the United Kingdom and the European Union.\u00a0\nThe Federal Reserve said banks and credit unions of all sizes can sign up and use the tool. There are about 35 such financial institutions on the list already. In addition, 16 service providers are on board to support payment processing for banks and credit unions.\nAs TX Zhuo, managing partner of Fika Ventures, noted in a June guest column, contract employees can now get paid immediately and by other means than cash, and smaller financial institutions can now offer the same level of service that large institutions and fintechs can. The ability to get paid quicker through FedNow may also reduce the need for people to take out payday loans.\nFuture FedNow features coming down the pipeline include bank and credit union customers being able to send instant payments \u201cquickly and securely\u201d via their financial institution\u2019s mobile app or website.\nIf the success of Pix in Brazil is any indication, the potential for FedNow to be a game-changer in the U.S. is massive. Payments company Matera reviewed data from the Central Bank of Brazil and found that Pix transactions for Q1 2023 totaled 8.1 billion versus 4.2 billion credit card and 3.8 billion debit card transactions. Noted Matera: \u201cThis is the first quarter where the number of Pix transactions were more than credit and debit combined.\u201d\nIndustry reaction\nFedNow might be immediate, but some in the financial industry, like Airbase CEO Thejo Kote, believe it will take some time for this to catch on.\n\u201cBanks on both the receiving end and the sending end have to be able to support these new protocols and this new kind of rails, and that\u2019s a slow process,\u201d Kote previously said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic that over the next few years, the coverage will continue to get much better. However, in the here-and-now, the vast majority of dollars are still flowing through the Automated Clearing House network, and that has a whole host of challenges that you have to work [with].\u201d\nNacha, the organization that governs the ACH network in the U.S., issued a statement noting that \u201cinstant payment systems (such as FedNow and RTP) and ACH, including Same Day ACH, will together meet the evolving needs of the marketplace,\u201d and that \u201clarge volumes of scheduled and recurring payments between known counterparties on known due dates\u2013payroll and benefit Direct Deposits, bill payments, B2B payments and account transfers\u2013will continue to be served well by ACH.\u201d\nThere is already a bit of drama surrounding the launch. Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, tweeted about why Adyen, a public European fintech company, was able to get on the list of participants offering FedNow, when, in her words, \u201cisn\u2019t the Fed keeping #fintechs out???\u201d\nIn a statement, Adyen confirmed that it had obtained a U.S. banking branch license in 2021 and was \u201camong the first to complete testing and receive certification to utilize the FedNow(R) Service.\u201d\u00a0\nFor its part, the Financial Technology Association released a statement on July 20, welcoming the new instant payments system in the U.S. FTA President and CEO Penny Lee said in a statement:\n\u201cFedNow means more consumers and businesses can send and receive payments in seconds instead of days through their financial institutions. Instant payments will provide additional options for consumers to pay bills on time, access their paychecks more quickly, and avoid overdraft fees and predatory lenders. It will also help businesses better manage expenses, decrease errors, and reduce costs.\u201d\nSome fintech leaders too seem enthusiastic. \nStephany Kirkpatrick, Orum CEO and co-founder, believes that FedNow presents a massive opportunity for fintechs to build bridges between the different payment rails. She added: \u201cFinancial institutions and fintechs will need to figure out how to integrate FedNow across the broader payment network and this challenge of interoperability creates a great opportunity for innovation geared towards orchestrating payments across these different systems for the benefit of so many.\u201d\nDimitri Dadiomov, CEO of fintech startup Modern Treasury, applauded FedNow\u2019s launch, saying: \u201cGreater access to instant payments in the U.S. marks a sea change in the speed of money movement, which will enable businesses and consumers to transact faster and with more confidence and ease than ever\u2026Everyone benefits when economies are more efficient and instant payments are a pillar of a more efficient money movement ecosystem.\u201d\nStill, as one Twitter user points out, there is one group of people that may not yet be on board: the American consumer. A startlingly larger-than-expected number of the population still prefer paper payments. But with the government\u2019s very public endorsement of digital payments with the launch of FedNow, that may be changing.\nWant more fintech news in your inbox?

The company generated revenue of around $15.5 billion, down a disappointing 0.4% from its year-ago result. However, even inside its less-than-stellar report, there were some favorable tidbits for the well-known tech giant.\nOn the negative side, IBM\u2019s infrastructure business is deep in the doldrums with revenue down 14.6% to $3.6 billion, compared to year-ago metrics. That overall loss includes IBM Z Systems, the company\u2019s mainframe business, falling 30% on its own. Z Systems has been pretty solid for the company in the past, so it\u2019s sobering news to see it doing so poorly.\nOn the bright side, software revenues were up 7.2% in IBM\u2019s most recent quarter to $6.6 billion with Red Hat leading the way up 11%, making the $34 billion purchase in 2018 look better with each passing quarter. You could even argue that without Red Hat, IBM would be in much worse shape.\nCEO Arvind Krishna has been looking to squeeze out modest growth for his company, but Big Blue failed to achieve even that in the second quarter.\nStill, as IBM doubles down on its hybrid cloud strategy, where its goal is to act as a trusted partner to manage infrastructure wherever it lives, there are a couple of decent signals for the future, including anticipated revenue growth of 3% to 5% at constant currency rates. And it expects $10.5 billion in free cash flow this quarter, up $1 billion from year-ago results.\nSeveral parts of IBM are contributing to its modest growth trajectory. Apart from rising software revenues, its consulting division had a decent report this quarter, expanding its top line by 4.3% compared to year-ago results to $5 billion. Those folks help large companies manage their hybrid cloud implementations, among other things.\nRecently IBM went out and spent a hefty $4.6 billion to buy Apptio, which builds software to help better understand where resources are allocated, whether on-prem or in the cloud. That deal isn\u2019t expected to close until later this year, but it\u2019s clear that it could be a way to squeeze out additional revenue from the hybrid cloud approach, and it could add a layer of revenue to the company\u2019s forward results that will bolster year-over-year comparisons in the future.\nWhat about AI?\nIBM also sees AI as being inextricably linked to its hybrid strategy. In May, the company introduced a refresh of Watson, an artificial intelligence platform called Watsonx that takes advantage of the new generation of large language models. While IBM frittered away its head start with Watson, which emerged in 2011 with its famous \u201cJeopardy\u201d victory, it\u2019s hoping to take advantage of the new interest in AI.",

        "content": "The developers of the popular iPhone app Camera+, LateNiteSoft, have launched a new iOS app called Photon. This new app is focused on pro image shooting. The developers are banking on the app\u2019s simple interface and multiformat support to attract users.\nThe app will let you shoot in auto mode from the get-go, but it also has easy access to controls for adjusting focus, shutter speed, ISO (sensor\u2019s sensitivity to light) and white balance (a way to adjust how \u201cwarm\u201d or \u201ccool\u201d your image is).\nUsers can download and shoot in auto mode for free, but they will have to pay a subscription to use the pro features \u2014 $3.99 per month or $19.99 per year. The company is also offering a lifetime subscription for $39.99 for a limited time. At the moment, the makers of the app are also offering a seven-day trial for the app.\nImage Credits: Photon app\nFrom the main interface, you can quickly access buttons to change the format of an image, the resolution of the photo and flash control, and switch between lenses like wide, ultra-wide, telephoto and selfie.\nOn top of the viewfinder, there is a flash control on the left with modes like auto, on, off and torch. On the top-right, users can see a histogram \u2014 a graph that represents different light tones in the photo.\nBy default, the camera also offers a 3 x 3 grid, which could help you capture an object using the \u201crule of thirds.\u201d For the uninitiated, the rule is often about placing a subject in such a way that the other two-thirds of the frame is open.\nAll manual controls \u2014 focus, shutter speed, ISO and white balance \u2014 cab be tweaked using sliders to adjust the measures. The screen will also show numeric values of things like white balance in degrees Kelvin and the percentage of maximum focus distance offered by the camera.\nImage Credits: Photon app\nThe app supports JPEG, HEIF, True RAW and ProRAW formats, and users can save a combination of JPEG/HEIF with RAW. Users can also easily look at all photos they took in a session without leaving the app and discard the ones they don\u2019t want.\nImage Credits: Photon app\nLateNiteSoft, the company releasing the app, has also prepared a detailed manual for Photon so that anyone \u2014 even photo beginners \u2014 can learn more about using manual controls to take pictures.\nThe app will directly compete with incumbents like the popular Halide app, which offers a relatively cheaper subscription at $2.99 per month and $11.99 per year.\nHowever, No\u00ebl Rosenthal, a product manager at the company, believes the learning curve for this app is steep. With Photon, the startup wants to make it easier to learn pro photography.\n\u201cPhoton is the product of our more than 10 years of experience in the photography business, without all the baggage. We took the time to rethink every aspect of the shooting experience, considering all of the feedback we\u2019ve received and the impacts of all of our choices in the past. What we have produced is, in our eyes, simply the best, most intuitive, accessible, but powerful way to shoot photos on the iPhone,\u201d he said.\n",

        "content": "Space-based internet startup Astranis said Friday that its first commercial internet satellite will be unable to provide continuous coverage to Alaska due to a malfunction with both spacecraft\u2019s solar panels.\nThe San Francisco-based company launched the dedicated internet satellite for Alaska, called Arcturus, on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy at the beginning of May. Shortly after, the company reported that it was performing nominally. But Astranis CEO John Gedmark said the satellite \u201cabruptly experienced\u201d a pointing issue with the solar array drive assembly, the component that rotates the solar arrays relative to the sun. As a result of this issue, the solar arrays are no longer capable of providing adequate power to the spacecraft.\n\u201cThis is a frustrating situation \u2014 the Arcturus spacecraft is in a safe state and fully under our control, the payload and our other Astranis in-house designed components are all working perfectly, and the tanks are fueled for years of on-orbit operation,\u201d Gedmark said. \u201cBut unless something major changes, the mission of providing internet connectivity in Alaska will be delayed.\u201d\nInstead, Astranis is moving to Plan B. The company is going to launch a previously undisclosed \u201cUtilitySat\u201d as an on-orbit backup for the hobbled Arcturus. That satellite will head to orbit as part of a batch of four satellites the company is aiming to launch later this year on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rideshare mission. While UtilitySat is the same size as Arcturus, around 400 kilograms, it will have lower capacity and won\u2019t entirely make up for the lost coverage.\nGedmark said he anticipates fully replacing the Alaska sat in early 2025.\nAstranis\u2019 internet satellites operate in geostationary orbit, at an altitude that is around 22,000 miles above the Earth\u2019s surface. Generally, satellites that operate in this orbit (as opposed to the much closer low Earth orbit) cost upwards of hundreds of millions to billions of dollars. These exorbitant costs are due in part to the fuel requirements and size of the satellites. But Astranis\u2019 alternative approach may come in handy for precisely moments like these: Its satellites are cheaper, easier to manufacture and quicker to launch, so an on-orbit malfunction \u2014 though still spelling the death of that particular satellite \u2014 does not mean the same financial loss as other satellites in GEO.\nThe difference is especially illuminating given the recent news that Viasat\u2019s 6,400-kilogram ViaSat-3 satellite \u2014 which was the primary payload on the same Falcon Heavy launch that Arcturus hitched a ride on \u2014 is also having hardware issues. That issue could result in a staggering $420 million insurance claim.\n\u201cOur satellites are smaller and more flexible, and we build them faster and in higher quantities, than those of traditional satellite manufacturers,\u201d Gedmark said. \u201cThat means a setback worst-case becomes a delay in the start of service, not an end to the mission.\u201d\n",

        "content": "CB Insights released its Q2 State of Fintech report last week, and unsurprisingly, global funding in the space was down \u2014 plunging by nearly half to $7.8 billion, its lowest level since 2017.\nBut at least one region didn\u2019t have a bad quarter.\nLatin America experienced a surge in global investor interest in recent years, but just as other regions globally, it has experienced a dip in venture funding.\nVC investors deployed $7.8 billion across a record 1,114 deals in Latin America in 2022, down from $15.9 billion in 2021, according to The Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America (LAVCA). The fintech sector by far was the biggest recipient of venture dollars in 2022, making up 29% of investments last year.\nIt appears that investors in the region are continuing to bet on the space. In fact, according to CB Insights\u2019 State of Fintech Q2 report, fintechs in LatAm & the Caribbean drew $500 million, up 150% QoQ, while deal count (69) remained roughly the same QoQ. Early-stage deal share is pacing at 81% for 2023, a five-year high, the report found. The region\u2019s top deal in the quarter went to Cayman Islands-based DeFi platform Kross Wallet, which raised a $100 million seed round. (Blockchain and crypto companies are counted as fintech in CB Insights\u2019 data.) Other deals taking place during the quarter include Mexico-based spend management startup Clara\u2019s $60 million raise and Brazilian payments infrastructure company Liquido bringing in $26 million. (It should be noted that those rounds were actually raised in 2021 but because it was operating in stealth, Liquido only recently announced the financings.)\n\nFintech valuations have fallen. Where do they go from here?\n\nBut overall, the second quarter was not kind to payments startups, even though the sector started the year off strong. Funding to these kinds of companies plunged 75% during the quarter to $2 billion from $8 billion in the first quarter and $4.9 billion for the second quarter in 2022. CB Insights noted this was a \u201csix-year funding low for the sector.\u201d And there were no new unicorns.\nDeal volume didn\u2019t hurt as bad, though second-quarter investments fell 14% to 148 from 172 deals made in the first quarter. One bright spot was that early-stage funding to payments companies reached a five-year high.\nTipalti, which automates accounts payables for mid-market companies, had the top equity deal for the quarter, raising $150 million in a growth round, and adding to its impressive list of gigantic investments, like its $270 million Series F and $150 million Series E. Others on the list include Nymbus, Clara, Volt, Spiff and Episode Six.\nLastly, all five of the quarter\u2019s IPO exits come from fintechs based outside of the United States, with four of them coming from Asia. Also, fntech saw a 20% drop in M&A activity, to 142 exits, according to CB Insights.\nWant more fintech news in your inbox? Sign up for The Interchange here.\n",

        "content": "Plastic in ocean bad. Plastic not in ocean good. That\u2019s, in a nutshell, the pitch for CleanHub. The company has designed a whole business model and a track-and-trace model around that, so brands can rest assured that their plastics don\u2019t end up in the oceans. Who these brands are and what happens to the plastic instead is, unfortunately, a little bit of a mystery.\n\nWe\u2019re looking for more unique pitch decks to tear down, so if you want to submit your own, here\u2019s how you can do that.\u00a0\n\nSlides in this deck\nCleanHub used a tight, 12-slide deck to get its point across. The only redaction in the deck is details about co-founder and co-CEO Louis\u2019s previous exit. The deck does miss a couple pieces of information that I\u2019d typically want to see, but before we get to that, let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s in there.\n\nCover slide\nTeam slide\nVision slide\nProblem slide\nValue proposition slide 1\nSolution slide\nMarketplace vision slide\nProduct slide\nTechnology overview 1\n\u00a0Technology overview 2\n\u00a0Value proposition slide 2\n\u00a0Market size slide\n\nThree things to love\nCleanHub is building a marketplace for the circular economy of plastic. That\u2019s a bold and challenging space to be in: Marketplaces are notoriously hard to build, and plastic garbage is a tough sell. Still, there are some cracking slides to convince us otherwise.\nA great overview\n[Slide 7] Gotta love a good overview slide. Image Credits: CleanHubCleanHub is built on a bold idea, and that\u2019s going to require some pretty big shifts in the market. This slide, outlining the flow of money, data and content, is an interesting way to start building that story. The clever thing here is that all three of these things have value. Money has value (duh, that\u2019s why we are here, reading this article), but the more subtle value of verifiable data and the stories that can be told with that data make this stand out.\nGiving waste value\n[Slide 5] Like carbon credits, but for plastic. Image Credits: CleanHubThe biggest innovation CleanHub brings to the space is the introduction of plastic credits, which, if I\u2019m reading this slide right, can make waste tradeable in a way it wasn\u2019t before.\nI don\u2019t fully understand how this would work (more on this below), but prima facie, this is a story I haven\u2019t heard before, and it arouses my curiosity.\nTeam team team!\n[Slide 2] If you\u2019ve got a great team, brag about it as hard as you can. Image Credits: CleanHubFounder/market fit is the name of the game for early-stage startups, and this company is showing it has it in spades: All three founders have a lot of experience, and there isn\u2019t too much overlap here. There\u2019s startup experience from Louis, domain expertise from Joel, and technical expertise from Florin. On paper (or, well, on slide deck), this looks like a well-formed, experienced team.\nCleanHub has two co-CEOs, which gives me pause. The CEO\u2019s role is typically well-defined, and two in this case isn\u2019t always better than one. I would push the team here, focusing on conflict-resolution skills. The answer as to why there are two CEOs could trigger a number of red flags about team cohesion and staying power.\nIn the rest of this teardown, we\u2019ll take a look at three things CleanHub could have improved or done differently, along with its full pitch deck!",

The official rollout for Premium users comes a month after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov announced that the messaging app would be adding Stories in July. It\u2019s currently unknown when Telegram plans to launch Stories for non-Premium users.\nAt the time, Durov said users had been asking for the feature for years, noting that more than half of all feature requests that Telegram receives are related to Stories. The company was initially against adding Stories because they \u201care already everywhere,\u201d but wanted to listen to its users, Durov had said.\nWith Stories on Telegram, you can decide who can see each of your stories. You can choose to have your Stories viewable by everyone, your contacts, a few selected contacts or a list of close friends. Stories will be placed in an expandable section at the top of your chat list. You can hide Stories posted by any contact by moving them to the \u201cHidden\u201d list in your Contacts section instead of the main screen.\nIn addition, you can add captions and links to your Stories. There\u2019s also the option to tag other people in your Stories. Plus, you will be able to post photos and videos taken with the front and rear cameras simultaneously in a BeReal-like style.\nYou can choose when your story expires. For instance, you can have it expire in six, 12, 24 or 48 hours. Or, you can permanently display Stories on your profile page in a way that\u2019s similar to how Instagram lets you display Story highlights.\nDurov previously said that following internal tests of Stories, even the skeptics on the Telegram team started to appreciate the feature and that Telegram can no longer imagine the messaging service without it.\n",

        "content": "As generative AI enters the mainstream, so, too, does AI-generated porn. And like its more respectable sibling, it\u2019s improving.\nWhen TechCrunch covered efforts to create AI porn generators nearly a year ago, the apps were nascent and relatively few and far between. And the results weren\u2019t what anyone would call \u201cgood.\u201d\nThe apps and the AI models underpinning them struggled to understand the nuances of anatomy, often generating physically bizarre subjects that wouldn\u2019t be out of place in a Cronenberg film. People in the synthetic porn had extra limbs or a nipple where their nose should be, among other disconcerting, fleshy contortions.\nFast-forward to today, and a search for \u201cAI porn generator\u201d turns up dozens of results across the web \u2014 many of which are free to use. As for the images, while they aren\u2019t perfect, some could well be mistaken for professional artwork.\nAnd the ethical questions have only grown.\nNo easy answers\nAs AI porn and the tools to create it become commodified, they\u2019re beginning to have frightening real-world impacts.\nTwitch personality Brandon Ewing, known online as Atrioc, was recently caught on stream looking at nonconsensually deepfaked sexual images of well-known women streamers on Twitch. The creator of the deepfaked images eventually succumbed to pressure, agreeing to delete them. But the damage had been done. To this day, the targeted creators receive copies of the images via DMs as a form of harassment.\nThe vast majority of pornographic deepfakes on the web depict women, in truth \u2014 and frequently, they\u2019re weaponized.\nA Washington Post piece recounts how a small-town school teacher lost her job after students\u2019 parents learned about AI porn made in the teacher\u2019s likeness without her consent. Just a few months ago, a 22-year-old was sentenced to six months in jail for taking underage womens\u2019 photos from social media and using them to create sexually explicit deepfakes.\nIn an even more disturbing example of the ways in which generative porn tech is being used, there\u2019s been a small but meaningful uptick in the amount of photorealistic AI-generated child sexual abuse material circulating on the dark web. In one instance reported by Fox News, a 15-year-old boy was blackmailed by a member of an online gym enthusiast group who used generative AI to edit a photo of the boy\u2019s bare chest into a nude.\nReddit users have been scammed with AI porn models, meanwhile \u2014 sold explicit images of people who don\u2019t exist. And workers in adult films and art have raised concerns about what this means for their livelihoods \u2014 and their industry.\nNone of this has deterred Unstable Diffusion, one of the original groups behind AI porn generators, from forging ahead.\nEnter Unstable Diffusion\nWhen Stable Diffusion, the text-to-image AI model developed by Stability AI, was open sourced late last year, it didn\u2019t take long for the internet to wield it for porn-creating purposes. One group, Unstable Diffusion, grew especially quickly on Reddit, then Discord. And in time, the group\u2019s organizers began exploring ways to build \u2014 and monetize \u2014 their own porn-generating models on top of Stable Diffusion.\nStable Diffusion, like all text-to-image AI systems, was trained on a dataset of billions of captioned images to learn the associations between written concepts and images, such as how the word \u201cbird\u201d can refer not only to bluebirds but parakeets and bald eagles in addition to far more abstract notions.\nOne of the more vanilla images created with Unstable Diffusion. Image Credits: Unstable Diffusion\nOnly a small percentage of Stable Diffusion\u2019s dataset contains NSFW material, giving the model little to go on when it comes to adult content. So Unstable Diffusion\u2019s admins recruited volunteers \u2014 mostly Discord server members \u2014 to create porn datasets for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion.\nDespite a few bumps in the road, including bans from both Kickstarter and Patreon, Unstable Diffusion managed to roll out a fully fledged website with custom art-generating AI models. After raising over $26,000 from donors, securing hardware to train generative AI and creating a dataset of more than 30 million photographs, Unstable Diffusion launched a platform that it claims is now being used by more than 350,000 people to generate over half a million images every day.\nArman Chaudhry, one of the co-founders of Unstable Diffusion and Equilibrium AI, an associated group, says Unstable Diffusion\u2019s focus remains the same: creating a platform for AI art that \u201cupholds the freedom of expression.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re making strides in launching our website and premium services, offering an art platform that\u2019s more than just a tool \u2014 it\u2019s a space for creativity to thrive without undue constraints,\u201d he told me via email. \u201cOur belief is that art, in its many forms, should be uncensored, and this philosophy guides our approach to AI tools and their usage.\u201d\nThe Unstable Diffusion server on Discord, where the community posts much of the art from Unstable Diffusion\u2019s generative tools, reflects this no-holds-barred philosophy.\nThe image-sharing portion of the server is divided into two main categories, \u201cSFW\u201d and \u201cNSFW,\u201d with the number of subcategories in the latter slightly outnumbering those in the former. Images in SFW run the gamut from animals and food to interiors, cities and landscapes. NSFW contains \u2014 as one might expect \u2014 explicit images of men and women, but also of nonbinary people, furries, \u201cnonhumans\u201d and \u201csynthetic horrors\u201d (think people with multiple appendages or skin melded with the background scenery).\nA more adult, furry product of Unstable Diffusion. Image Credits: Unstable Diffusion\nWhen we last poked around Unstable Diffusion, practically the entirety of the server could\u2019ve been filed in the \u201csynthetic horrors\u201d channel. Owing to a lack of training data and technical roadblocks, the community\u2019s models in late 2022 struggled to produce anything close to photorealism \u2014 or even halfway decent art.\nPhotorealistic images remain a challenge. But now, much of the artwork from Unstable Diffusion\u2019s models \u2014 anime-style, cell-shaded and so on \u2014 is at least anatomically plausible, and, in some rare cases, spot on.\nImproving quality\nMany images on the Unstable Diffusion Discord server are the product of a mix of tools, models and platforms \u2014 not strictly the Unstable Diffusion web app. So in the interest of seeing how far the Unstable Diffusion models specifically had come, I conducted an informal test, producing a bunch of SFW and NSFW images depicting people of different genders, races and ethnicities engaged in\u2026 well, coitus.\n(I can\u2019t say I expected to be testing porn generators in the course of covering AI. Yet, here we are. The tech industry is nothing if not unpredictable, truly.)\nAn NSFW image from Unstable Diffusion, cropped. Image Credits: Unstable Diffusion\nNothing about the Unstable Diffusion app screams \u201cporn.\u201d It\u2019s a relatively bareboned interface, with options to adjust image post-processing effects such as saturation, aspect ratio and the speed of the image generation. In addition to the prompt, Unstable Diffusion lets you specify things that you want excluded from generated images. And, as the whole thing\u2019s a commercial endeavor, there\u2019s paid plans to increase the number of simultaneous image generation requests you can make at one time.\nPrompts run through the Unstable Diffusion website yield serviceable results, I found \u2014 albeit not predictable ones. The models clearly don\u2019t quite understand the mechanics of sex, resulting, sometimes, in odd facial expressions, impossible positions and unnatural genitalia. Generally speaking, the simpler the prompt (e.g. solo pin-ups), the better the results. And most scenes involving more than two people are recipes for hellish nightmares. (Yes, this writer tried a range of prompts. Please don\u2019t judge me.)\nThe models shows the telltale signs of generative AI bias, though.\nMore often than not, prompts for \u201cmen\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d run through Unstable Diffusion render images of white or Asian people \u2014 a likely symptom of imbalances in the training dataset. Most prompts for gay porn, meanwhile, inexplicably default to people of ambiguously LatinX descent with an undercut hairstyle. Is that indicative of the types of gay porn the models were trained on? One can speculate.\nThe body types aren\u2019t very diverse by default, either. Men are muscular and tone, with six packs. Women are thin and curvy. Unstable Diffusion is very well capable of generating subjects in more shapes and sizes, but it has to be explicitly instructed to do so in the prompt, which I\u2019d argue isn\u2019t the most inclusive practice.\nThe bias manifests differently in professional gender roles, curiously. Given a prompt containing the word \u201csecretary\u201d and no other descriptors, Unstable Diffusion often depicts an Asian woman in a submissive position, likely an artifact of an over-representation of this particular \u2014 erm \u2014 setup in the training data.\n\nA gay couple, as depicted by Unstable Diffusion. Image Credits: Unstable Diffusion\nBias issue aside, one might assume that Unstable Diffusion\u2019s technical breakthroughs would lead the group to double down on AI-generated porn. But that isn\u2019t the case, surprisingly.\nWhile the Unstable Diffusion founders remain dedicated to the idea of generative AI without limits, they\u2019re looking to adopt more\u2026 palatable messaging and branding for the mass market. The team, now at five people full-time, is working to evolve Unstable Diffusion into a software-as-a-service business, selling subscriptions to the web app to fund product improvements and customer support.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate to have a community of users who are incredibly supportive. Still, we recognize that to take Unstable Diffusion to the next level, we would benefit from strategic partnerships and additional investment,\u201d Chaudhry said. \u201cWe want to ensure we\u2019re providing value to our subscribers while also keeping our platform accessible to those who are just getting started in the world of AI art.\u201d\nTo set itself apart in ways beyond a liberal content policy, Unstable Diffusion is heavily emphasizing customization. Users can change the color palette of generated images, for example, Chaudhry notes, and choose from an array of art styles including \u201cdigital art,\u201d \u201cphoto,\u201d \u201canime\u201d and \u201cgeneralist.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve focused on ensuring that our system can generate beautiful and aesthetically pleasing images from the simplest of prompts, making our platform accessible to both novices and experienced users,\u201d Chaudhry said. \u201c[Our system] gives users the power to guide the image generation process.\u201d\nContent moderation\nElsewhere, spurred by its efforts to chase down mainstream investors and customers, Unstable Diffusion claims to have spent significant resources creating a \u201crobust\u201d content moderation system.\nA Chris Hemsworth lookalike, created with Unstable Diffusion\u2019s tools. Image Credits: Unstable Diffusion\nBut wait, you might say \u2014 isn\u2019t content moderation antithetical to Unstable Diffusion\u2019s mission? Apparently not. Unstable Diffusion does\u00a0draw the line at images that could land it in legal hot water, including pornographic deepfakes of celebrities and porn depicting characters who appear to be 18 years old or younger \u2014 fictional or not.\nTo wit, a number of U.S. states have laws against deepfake porn on the books, and there\u2019s at least one effort in Congress to make sharing nonconsensual AI-generated porn illegal in the U.S.\nIn addition to blocking specific words and phrases, Unstable Diffusion\u2019s moderation system leverages an AI model that attempts to identify and automatically delete images that violate its policies. Chaudhry says that the filters are currently set to be \u201chighly sensitive,\u201d erring on the side of caution, but that Unstable Diffusion is soliciting feedback from the community to \u201cfind the right balance.\u201d\n\u201cWe prioritize the safety of our users and are committed to making our platform a space where creativity can thrive without concerns of inappropriate content,\u201d Chaudhry said. \u201cWe want our users to feel safe and secure when using our platform, and we\u2019re committed to maintaining an environment that respects these values.\u201d\nThe deepfake filters don\u2019t appear to be that\u00a0strict. Unstable Diffusion generated nudes of several of the celebrities I tried without complaint (\u201cChris Hemsworth,\u201d \u201cDonald Trump\u201d), save particularly photorealistic or accurate ones (Donald Trump was gender-swapped).\nA deepfaked, gender-swapped image of Donald Trump, created with Unstable Diffusion. Image Credits: Unstable Diffusion\nAfter this article\u2019s publication, Unstable Diffusion said that it found a \u201cbug\u201d in the filter system that allowed content against its usage policy to be generated. It\u2019s now fixed this bug, supposedly, and added statistical monitoring to its filter system \u201cto catch such issues earlier should they happen again.\u201d\n\u201cUnstable Diffusion has always been known for cracking down hard on deepfake attempts and have rejected numerous funding and collaboration deal due to our anti-deepfake policy,\u201d a spokesperson said via email. \u201cWe\u2019re extremely committed to combating deepfakes and immediately disabled our site while we worked on remedying the problem. It\u2019s now back online and we have tested the celebrities in the article and they are all appropriately banned.\u201d\nFuture issues\nAssuming Unstable Diffusion receives the investment it\u2019s seeking, it plans to shore up compute infrastructure \u2014 an ongoing challenge given the growing size of its community. (Having used the site a fair amount, I can attest to the heavy load \u2014 images usually take around a minute to generate.) It also plans to build more customization options and social sharing features, using the Discord server as a springboard.\n\u201cWe aim to transition our engaged and interactive community from our Discord to our website, encouraging users to share, collaborate and learn from one another,\u201d Chaudhry said. \u201cOur community is a core strength \u2014 one that we plan to integrate with our service and provide tools for them to expand and succeed.\u201d\nBut I\u2019m struggling with what \u201csuccess\u201d looks like for Unstable Diffusion. On the one hand, the group aims to be taken seriously as a generative art platform. On the other, as evidenced by the Discord server, it\u2019s still a wellspring of porn \u2014 some of which is quite off-putting.\nAs the platform exists today, traditional VC funding is off the table. Vice clauses bar institutional funds from investing in pornographic ventures, funneling them instead to \u201csidecar\u201d funds set up under the radar by fund managers.\nEven if it ditched the adult content, Unstable Diffusion, which forces users to pay for a premium plan to use the images they generate commercially, would have to deal with the elephant in the generative AI room: artist consent and compensation. Like most generative AI art models, Unstable Diffusions models are trained on artwork from around the web, not necessarily with the creator\u2019s knowledge. Many artists take issue with \u2014 and have sued over, in fact \u2014 AI systems that mimic their styles without giving proper credit or payment.\nThe furry art community FurAffinity decided to ban AI-generated SFW and NSWF art altogether, as did Newgrounds, which hosts mature art behind a filter. Only recently did Reddit walk back its ban on AI-generated porn, and only partially: art on the platform must depict fictional characters.\n\nIn a previous interview with TechCrunch, Chaudhry said that Unstable Diffusion would look at ways to make its models \u201cmore equitable toward the artistic community.\u201d But from what I can tell, there\u2019s not been any movement on that front.\n\nIndeed, like the ethics around AI-generated porn, Unstable Diffusion\u2019s situation seems unlikely to resolve anytime soon. The group seems doomed to a holding pattern, trying to bootstrap while warding off controversy and avoiding alienating the community \u2014 and artists \u2014 that made it.\nI can\u2019t say I envy them.\n",

        "title": "OpenAI\u2019s head of trust and safety Dave Willner steps down",
        "content": "A significant personnel change is afoot at OpenAI, the artificial intelligence juggernaut that has nearly single-handedly inserted the concept of generative AI into global public discourse with the launch of ChatGPT. Dave Willner, an industry veteran who was the startup\u2019s head of trust and safety, announced in a post on LinkedIn last night (first spotted by Reuters) that he has left the job and transitioned to an advisory role. He plans to spend more time with his young family, he said. He\u2019d been in the role for a year and a half.\nOpenAI said in a statement that it\u2019s seeking a replacement and that CTO Mira Murati will manage the team on an interim basis. \u201cWe thank Dave for his valuable contributions to OpenAI,\u201d it said. The full statement is below.\nHis departure is coming at a critical time for the world of AI.\nAlongside all the excitement about the capabilities of generative AI platforms \u2014 based on large language or other foundational models and are lighting-fast at producing freely-generated text, images, music and more based on simple prompts from users \u2014 there has been a growing list of questions. How best to regulate activity and companies in this brave new world? How best to mitigate any harmful impacts across a whole spectrum of issues? Trust and safety are foundational parts of those conversations.\nJust today, OpenAI\u2019s president Greg Brockman is due to appear at the White House alongside execs from Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon to endorse voluntary commitments to pursue shared safety and transparency goals ahead of an AI executive order that\u2019s in the works. That comes in the wake of a lot of noise in Europe related to AI regulation, as well as shifting sentiments among some others.\nThe importance of all this is not lost on OpenAI, which has sought to position itself as an aware and responsible player in the field.\nWillner doesn\u2019t make any reference to any of that specifically in his LinkedIn post. Instead, he keeps it high-level, noting\u00a0that the demands of his OpenAI job shifted into a \u201chigh-intensity phase\u201d after the launch of ChatGPT.\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of everything our team has accomplished in my time at OpenAI, and while my job there was one of the coolest and most interesting jobs it\u2019s possible to have today, it had also grown dramatically in its scope and scale since I first joined,\u201d he wrote. While he and his wife \u2014 Charlotte Willner, who is also a trust and safety specialist \u2014 both made commitments to always put family first, he said, \u201cin the months following the launch of ChatGPT, I\u2019ve found it more and more difficult to keep up my end of the bargain.\u201d\nWillner has been in his OpenAI post for just 1.5 years, but he comes from a long career in the field that includes leading trust and safety teams at Facebook and Airbnb.\nThe Facebook work is especially interesting. There, he was an early employee who helped spell out the company\u2019s first community standards position, which is still used as the basis of the company\u2019s approach today.\nThat was a very formative period for the company, and arguably \u2014 given the influence Facebook has had on how social media has developed globally \u2014 for the internet and society overall. Some of those years were marked by very outspoken positions on the freedom of speech, and how Facebook needed to resist calls to rein in controversial groups and controversial posts.\nOne case in point was a very big dispute, in 2009, played out in the public forum about how Facebook was handling accounts and posts from Holocaust Deniers. Some employees and outside observers felt that Facebook had a duty to take a stand and ban those posts. Others believed that doing so was akin to censorship and sent the wrong message around free discourse.\nWillner was in the latter camp, believing that \u201chate speech\u201d was not the same as \u201cdirect harm\u201d and should therefore not be moderated the same. \u201cI do not believe that Holocaust Denial, as an idea on it\u2019s [sic] own, inherently represents a threat to the safety of others,\u201d he wrote at the time. (For a blast from the TechCrunch past, see the full post on this here.)\nIn retrospect, given how so much else has played out, it was a pretty short-sighted, na\u00efve position. But, it seems that at least some of those ideas did evolve. By 2019, no longer employed by the social network, he was speaking out against how the company wanted to grant politicians and public figures weaker content moderation exceptions.\nBut if the need for laying the right groundwork at Facebook was bigger than people at the time anticipated, that is arguably even more the case now for the new wave of tech. According to this New York Times story from less than a month ago, Willner had been brought on to OpenAI initially to help it figure out how to keep DALL-E, the startup\u2019s image generator, from getting misused and used for things like the creation of generative AI child pornography.\nBut as the saying goes, OpenAI (and the industry) needs that policy yesterday. \u201cWithin a year, we\u2019re going to be reaching very much a problem state in this area,\u201d David Thiel, the chief technologist of the Stanford Internet Observatory, told the NYT.\nNow, without Willner, who will lead OpenAI\u2019s charge to address that?\nUpdate: After publishing, OpenAI provided the following statement: \n\u201cWe thank Dave for his valuable contributions to OpenAI. His work has been foundational in operationalizing our commitment to the safe and responsible use of our technology, and has paved the way for future progress in this field. Mira Murati will directly manage the team on an interim basis, and Dave will continue to advise through the end of the year. We are seeking a technically-skilled lead to advance our mission, focusing on the design, development, and implementation of systems that ensure the safe use and scalable growth of our technology.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Natasha Lomas\n",

It now operates a fleet of more than 2,500 vehicles.\u00a0\nThe financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but according to a report by The Straits Times, the acquisition size is estimated at\u00a0around $75 million.\u00a0\nThe Nasdaq-listed ride-hailing giant says the acquisition will allow Grab to provide a more extensive base of drivers. Grab wants to address\u00a0Singapore\u2019s driver shortage issue as ride demand rebounded after the city state lifted the pandemic restrictions.\n\u201cBy boosting the number of drivers on our platform and helping them to operate more efficiently, we improve how quickly and reliably we find a ride for our passengers whenever they need one,\u201d Yee Wee Tang, managing director of Grab Singapore, said in a statement.\u00a0\nThe purchase comes just a month after the Southeast Asian super app operator laid off more than 1,000 employees, or about 11% of its staff.\n\nSingapore\u2019s ride-hailing firm Grab lays off over 1,100 employees\u00a0\n\nTrans-cab drivers will join the Grab platform and receive benefits provided to the current Grab drivers, including free coverage through Grab\u2019s Personal Accident Insurance and access to the GrabAcademy program, which helps the drivers learn skills, including data analytics and digital marketing. Rewards through loyalty programs also will be provided to the drivers.\u00a0\nGrab plans to integrate its driver application into Trans-cab\u2019s mobile display units to digitize the business. Grab\u2019s technology will enable Trans-cab taxi drivers to manage their earnings and receive bookings from Grab\u2019s platform and the existing call center of Trans-cab.\u00a0\n\u201cConsumer behaviors have shifted and we\u2019ve recognized for some time the need to digitize the business and ensure our taxi drivers can continue to be competitive,\u201d Jasmin Tan, general manager of Trans-cab, said.\u00a0\u00a0\nConsolidation via mergers and acquisitions is on the rise in the tech industry as tight private capital and a slow initial public offering market due to the economic downturn are impacted by growing inflations and high-interest rate headwinds.\u00a0\nIn April, Singapore\u2019s SMRT announced its ride-hailing operator Strides Taxi would merge with Premier Taxis to bring together a combined fleet of about 2,500 taxis, becoming the country\u2019s second-largest taxi operator.

        "content": "While substantive AI legislation may still be years away, the industry is moving at light speed and many \u2014 including the White House \u2014 are worried that it may get carried away. So the Biden administration has collected \u201cvoluntary commitments\u201d from seven of the biggest AI developers to pursue shared safety and transparency goals ahead of a planned executive order.\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are the companies taking part in this non-binding agreement, and will send representatives to the White House to meet with President Biden today.\nTo be clear, there is no rule or enforcement being proposed here \u2014 the practices agreed to are purely voluntary. But although no government agency will hold a company accountable if it shirks a few, it will also likely be a matter of public record.\nHere\u2019s the list of attendees at the White House gig:\n\nBrad Smith, President, Microsoft\nKent Walker, President, Google\nDario Amodei, CEO, Anthropic\nMustafa Suleyman, CEO, Inflection AI\nNick Clegg, President, Meta\nGreg Brockman, President, OpenAI\nAdam Selipsky, CEO, Amazon Web Services\n\nNo underlings, but no billionaires, either. (And no women.)\nThe seven companies (and likely others that didn\u2019t get the red carpet treatment but will want to ride along) have committed to the following:\n\nInternal and external security tests of AI systems before release, including adversarial \u201cred teaming\u201d by experts outside the company.\nShare information across government, academia and \u201ccivil society\u201d on AI risks and mitigation techniques (such as preventing \u201cjailbreaking\u201d).\nInvest in cybersecurity and \u201cinsider threat safeguards\u201d to protect private model data like weights. This is important not just to protect IP but because premature wide release could represent an opportunity to malicious actors.\nFacilitate third-party discovery and reporting of vulnerabilities, e.g. a bug bounty program or domain expert analysis.\nDevelop robust watermarking or some other way of marking AI-generated content.\nReport AI systems\u2019 \u201ccapabilities, limitations, and areas of appropriate and inappropriate use.\u201d Good luck getting a straight answer on this one.\nPrioritize research on societal risks like systematic bias or privacy issues.\nDevelop and deploy AI \u201cto help address society\u2019s greatest challenges\u201d like cancer prevention and climate change. (Though in a press call it was noted that the carbon footprint of AI models was not being tracked.)\n\nThough the above are voluntary, one can easily imagine that the threat of an executive order \u2014 they are \u201ccurrently developing\u201d one \u2014 is there to encourage compliance. For instance, if some companies fail to allow external security testing of their models before release, the EO may develop a paragraph directing the FTC to look closely at AI products claiming robust security. (One EO is already in force asking agencies to watch out for bias in development and use of AI.)\nThe White House is plainly eager to get out ahead of this next big wave of tech, having been caught somewhat flat-footed by the disruptive capabilities of social media. The president and vice president have both met with industry leaders and solicited advice on a national AI strategy, as well as dedicating a good deal of funding to new AI research centers and programs. Of course, the national science and research apparatus is well ahead of them, as this highly comprehensive (though necessarily slightly out of date) research challenges and opportunities report from the DOE and National Labs shows.\n",

        "content": "Tiger Global, DST Global, Peak XV, Steadview Capital and Kotak Private Equity are among global and Indian investors that have asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reconsider India\u2019s recently announced taxation on online gaming, saying the \u201conerous tax regime\u201d will lead to a write-off of $2.5 billion and loss of 1 million direct and indirect jobs.\nThe Goods and Services Tax Council, which comprises top federal and state finance ministers, said earlier this month that it had agreed to a levy of 28% at entry points on full face value for online gaming.\nThe GST Council\u2019s decision has \u201cunintended consequence of equating the constitutionally protected legitimate online skill gaming industry with gambling, betting and other \u2018games of chance,'\u201d a group of 30 investors wrote in a letter to Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, on Friday.\n\u201cWe invested in this sector with the vision to make India the gaming capital of the world, which would help in generating, among other things, high-skilled jobs, billions in foreign capital and make the country a net exporter of innovation in gaming and allied areas such as animation, artificial intelligence and visual effects,\u201d said the letter.\nOnline gaming is one of the fastest growing consumer internet businesses in India. Fantasy sports startups \u2014 including Dream Sports, backed by Tiger Global and Alpha Wave Global and valued at over $8 billion, and Sequoia India-backed Mobile Premier League \u2014 have altogether raised billions as a generation of internet users build a habit of making bets on real-world sporting events in hopes to make money. Friday\u2019s letter gives the online gaming startups in India an enterprise valuation of $20 billion.\nThe letter follows over 125 companies warning New Delhi that the sector is facing existential crisis and could face massive loss of investments due to the decision by the Goods and Services Tax Council. Dream11, the top fantasy sports startup in India, projected an 80% drop in its EBITDA following the new rule, Indian news outlet Arc reported earlier.\n\u201cThe current GST proposal will set up the most onerous tax regime for the gaming sector globally, which will lead to a potential write-off of the $2.5 billion capital invested in this sector,\u201d the investors\u2019 Friday letter said. \u201cThis will also adversely impact prospective investments to the tune of at least $4 billion in the next 3-4 years and hence the growth of the gaming sector in India.\u201d\nThrough the letter, a copy of which was reviewed by TechCrunch, the investors urged New Delhi to examine the following aspects before implementation of the new taxation rule:\na. If \u201cfull value of bets\u201d is understood in a manner where GST is levied on every contest played every time with fully taxed winnings, the GST burden will increase by 1,100% and on account of taxation of redeployed player winnings, the same money will get taxed repeatedly resulting in a scenario where over 50-70%% of every rupee will go towards GST , thereby making the online real money skill gaming business model unviable. This will lead to write off of investments made and would hurt the investor confidence.\nb. If \u201cfull value of bets\u201d for the purpose of levy of GST on online gaming is the full deposit value i.e. deposits made by users and not taxed again if the winnings are redeployed to play a game (at par with casinos), there will be a 350% increase in GST burden. This will result in the closure of most gaming startups and will require major restructuring across the industry to survive. Importantly, as deposits for online games are digital and made via authorised payment channels, it would allow GST authorities to track and verify all GSTfilings and remove any scope for manipulation by unscrupulous actors.\nc. If 28% GST is to be levied on the Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR)/Platform fees, there would be a 55% increase in GST quantum. This would ensure that the Indian online gaming operators are able to survive and are able to be a key contributor to the Indian economy. In addition, such a suggestion of levying GST on GGR would be in line with internationally accepted and proven practices.\n",

They can order products ranging from sanitary pads and contraceptives to diapers and cleaning supplies via its website or USSD.\nIn its first year, Kasha strictly approached the Rwandan market with a direct-to-consumer model offering last-mile delivery of health products for women and newborns. But it wouldn\u2019t take long for small shops to begin placing orders for these same products. The e-commerce platform, easily sensing an opportunity, ventured into wholesale after acquiring the necessary pharmaceutical license to serve pharmacies, hospitals and clinics. Serving a beachhead wholesale and retail market, Kasha products cut through newborn child health, maternal health and menstrual hygiene to family planning, sexual and reproductive health and noncommunicable diseases.\n\u201cWe have always understood that women are the most influential customer in the health space, both because they have the most health needs and are decision-makers for health in the household and unlock the rest of the population. Since many health products for women are stigmatized, Kasha has purposely offered a wide variety of products, including personal care products like soap, health products like contraceptives, and household staples like rice,\u201d Bichsel told TechCrunch in an interview. Bichsel also noted that the platform\u2019s most sold products include HIV self-tests, contraceptives, and pregnancy tests. \u201cWe have continued to expand our variety of products purely from customer demand and the needs of the different customer segments who purchase from us, including small kiosk shops, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics and consumers.\u201d\nStarting in Rwanda, Kasha raised $1.5 million in seed funding from angel and impact investors. In late 2020, after expansion into Kenya, Kasha secured a $3.6 million Series A from Finnfund, Swedfund, DFC and Mastercard Corporate. Knife Capital led this recent Series B with participation from Finnfund, DFC, Tim Koogle (ex-Yahoo CEO), Beyond Capital Ventures, Altree Capital, Bamboo Capital\u2019s BLOC Smart Africa Fund and Five35 Ventures.\n\u201cThe team [led by founder and CEO Joanna Bichsel] have proven their mettle in scaling rapidly to date and this round of capital will help to accelerate that,\u201d noted Koogle on the growth-stage deal. In addition to its operations in Kenya and Rwanda, Kasha, which has recently registered in South Africa, will use the investment to push its platform in the country and also West Africa later this year.\nSome members of Kasha\u2019s team\nAccording to Bichsel, optimizing around health products differentiates Kasha from other East African\u2013founded B2B e-commerce platforms, including Twiga and Wasoko, which have a more comprehensive range of SKUs outside pharmaceuticals (a product offering that Bichsel claims Kasha is the largest supplier of in Rwanda).\n\u201cOur core strategic focus is in the area of health and that\u2019s where we aim to win,\u201d she said while noting that Kasha has capabilities around telehealth and credit, a prominent feature of B2B e-commerce upstarts. \u201cIf a consumer orders from us and they don\u2019t have a prescription, we connect them to a doctor,\u201d said Bichsel, who worked several years for Microsoft and was a technology adviser to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \u201cThere are other health tech capabilities; we offer inventory credit to pharmacies, clinics and hospitals. So, we overlap in that general FMCG space, but our expertise is more in health. We also build a broader distribution network, reaching the mass market customer around the country and going to the last mile.\u201d\nTo ensure its products are authentic, the startup works directly with manufacturers and suppliers, sourcing and stocking the products it distributes to consumers, resellers and clinics. This is in tandem with its last-mile efforts of using various content channels to spread information on how its consumers can keep safe \u2014 and to the benefit of its enterprise business, where it provides visibility and insights to global health organizations on route to market strategies.\nSpeaking on the investment, Keet van Zyl, co-founder and partner at Knife Capital, a $50 million Pan-African fund, said, \u201cIn the current economic climate, it is refreshing to come across such a high-growth capital-efficient business that is female-led and optimized to serve the large mass market segment in Africa, being especially strong at serving women customers. We look forward to being a partner in the Pan-African expansion journey with this purpose-driven dedicated team.\u201d\nSince Kasha closed its Series A in late 2020, it has seen its annual recurring revenue grow by 50x, according to Bischel. She also mentioned that the company, widely misperceived as a social impact business in its early years, intends to \u201ccontinue growing its revenue aggressively, become a global company, achieve a strong return for investors and ideally go public.\u201d While it may seem grand for a female-founded and female-led startup whose counterparts commanded less than 3% of Africa\u2019s $6 billion venture capital market last year, Rwanda\u2019s most venture-backed company has hitched its wagon to a star and it might be only a matter of time before ambition becomes a reality. Bischel says:\nHaving reached this major milestone of closing our Series\u00a0 B, we are even more inspired and determined to achieve Kasha\u2019s mission of being Africa\u2019s leading digital platform for last-mile access to health. The exponential revenue growth we\u2019ve experienced over the last several years was driven by the high market demand for quality, affordable health products and household goods from mass market customers in urban and rural areas of East Africa, and this has proven out our business model and our team\u2019s ability to execute.\nWith Knife Capital leading our Series B, bringing their strong track record of portfolio companies that have scaled across the continent with successful exits to industry leading global corporations, provides us with the proven experience we need to achieve our ambitions as a company and to take it to the next level. We will be using the funds from Series B to expand across Africa and investing in strategic areas of the business to further continue our high growth trajectory. We are especially excited to have the continued support and reinvestment from existing Kasha investors such as FinnFund, DFC, Beyond Capital Ventures and others.\n\nSouth African VC firm Knife Capital gets first commitment for its $50M fund, to invest in 10-12 Series B rounds\n\n",

        "content": "Aurora Innovation, the self-driving technology company that aims to launch an autonomous trucking business in 2024, has completed a capital raise of $820 million from a public and concurrent private offering of its stock. The company expects the deal to close Friday.\nThe stock sale will help fund Aurora through commercial launch at the end of next year and \u201cwell into 2025,\u201d according to the company. Aurora said in November 2022 that it had enough money to get to mid-2024. The pre-revenue company has repeatedly said it would need to raise again to make it to launch and beyond.\nIn September 2022, a leaked memo showed that Aurora\u2019s CEO, Chris Urmson, had been weighing a range of options to preserve the company\u2019s cash position, including spinouts, layoffs, acquisitions and, of course, raises. In the memo, Urmson said there was value in finding \u201ca path to raise $300 million in the next year to add around six months to our runway.\u201d\nIn April, Aurora filed for a proposed mixed shelf offering to raise $350 million.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been transparent and said that we\u2019d need to raise more money before our commercial launch and profitability,\u201d Rachel Chibidakis, a spokesperson for Aurora, told TechCrunch. \u201cThis sizable capital raise is expected to get us through the launch of our autonomous trucking business, which is targeted for next year, and well into 2025.\u201d\nAurora, which has prioritized commercializing self-driving trucks, has pilot partnerships with FedEx, Paccar, Schneider, Werner and Xpress. The commercial launch will involve operating a fleet of about 20 trucks between Dallas and Houston, hauling freight for customers without a driver, a spokesperson told TechCrunch.\nAurora did not say specifically what it hopes to do with the funds. The company\u2019s prospectus is vague, stating that Aurora will use the money for \u201cworking capital and other general corporate purposes.\u201d Some of the money will be invested in short- and intermediate-term investment grade instruments. It\u2019s also possible a portion of the proceeds will go toward acquiring or investing in additional businesses, technologies, products or assets, the company wrote in a filing.\nThe raise is broken into two parts. Aurora is selling 73,333,333 shares of Class A common stock at the public offering price of $3 per share, or a value of $220 million. The company is also selling 222,222,216 shares privately at a price per share of $2.70, or a value of $600 million, per a prospectus that was filed Tuesday.\nShares were trading at $3.22 Tuesday at close before dropping sharply in after-hours trading to $2.87. Aurora\u2019s stock price closed Thursday at $2.92.\nAurora has not yet stated when it will report second-quarter earnings, at which time they will hopefully outline its plans for the cash. The company said in a filing that it expects to report $785 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30, 2023. That number does not include the $820 million from selling stock.\nThe names of the investors will come to light once the deal has closed Friday. Aurora only said that a number of existing institutional and strategic investors participated in the raise.\n\nHow Aurora is navigating the bumpy road to commercial self-driving trucks\n\n",

The company sold a low-power modem called Swarm M138 and a kit for IoT product development, and offered low-bandwidth satellite connectivity for as low as $5 per month.\nThe company was purchased by SpaceX in 2021, and it remains SpaceX\u2019s only acquisition. Longmier is now a senior direct of satellite engineering at SpaceX, while Spangelo is SpaceX\u2019s senior director satellite engineering \u2014 and the co-lead of the Direct to Cell initiative.\nSpaceX is most known for its Starlink satellite internet service, but the company announced last year that it would expand into cellular connectivity \u2014 an enormous market, especially in the developing world. Last summer, SpaceX and T-Mobile said they would launch a new service aimed at providing Starlink service to devices on T-Mobile\u2019s network. This effort is no doubt ramping up this year, with a SpaceX executive saying in March that service testing will begin this year. \n",

Supervised testing just means there\u2019s a human safety driver in the car. Cruise will switch to driverless testing before opening up the service for riders.\nMost of Cruise\u2019s operations have been in its hometown of San Francisco, where it competes head-to-head with Alphabet\u2019s Waymo. The two companies are currently in permit limbo as they await California\u2019s Public Utilities Commission to grant them both the right to charge for robotaxi services throughout the city 24/7. Despite support from the technology and business communities, Waymo and Cruise have run up against opposition from residents and city agencies, which may have caused the CPUC to delay hearings to approve their permits.\nCruise did not say whether it plans to launch its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts in Miami (although that might be tough now that GM has discontinued the vehicle) or if it\u2019ll put its own Cruise Origins on streets instead. Cruise\u2019s Origin is a purpose-built electric AV, built with no steering wheel or pedals for a human driver. In October 2021, Cruise\u2019s then-CEO Dan Ammann said the company will launch \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of Origins on public roads in the next few years.\nIn March, Cruise\u2019s current CEO Kyle Vogt said the company would begin testing its Origins on the streets in Austin within the coming weeks. While human-operated prototypes of the Origin have been manually collecting data used for AV perception system testing and validation, Cruise has not yet begun driverless tests in Austin. A spokesperson told TechCrunch Cruise would begin those tests \u201csoon.\u201d\nCruise isn\u2019t the first AV company to make it to Miami. Last year, Ford-backed Argo AI began testing a driverless service in Miami. The plan was to put the service on Lyft\u2019s platform, but Argo has since shut down.\n",

Facebook slapped a $2 billion check on the table and acquired the company in 2014.\nBut today, as it stands, VR is all but dead.\nVR \u2014 as in, a system for being exclusively in virtual reality \u2014 barely exists as a concept anymore. Even the cheapest mainstream headset out there, the Meta Quest 2, has a passthrough feature, meaning it\u2019s got AR capabilities. The Quest 3 adds higher-definition passthrough in full color.

It has been equal parts exciting and alarming to see the advancement of generative AI conversations with the breadth of applications increasingly understood.\nIt\u2019s our view that we are coming to the end of the hype cycle, and startups, even those that previously didn\u2019t have any generative AI plans, are beginning to look at immediate uses rather than just the moonshots and associated disruption it can cause, including in schools and workplaces.\nExploring immediate uses will help us make the micro-adjustments over time that ensure disruption is minimized once the longer-term projects begin to materialize. This theme has been well explored by others, so let\u2019s turn to other developments in H1 2023.\nWe had the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, which caused significant discomfort but had limited meaningful, long-term scarring on the ecosystem, particularly in Europe, given the actions of partners and governments. In the U.K., this respite was provided by HSBC, which stepped in to ensure stability for thousands of startups across the country, but minimal disruption was felt in the European Union, given the bank\u2019s limited presence in the markets.\nEdtech companies that raised rounds in H1 2023. Image Credits: Brighteye\nTurning now to global edtech, the market has continued to stutter, exemplified by Chegg\u2019s fluctuating valuation, kicked off not by unexpectedly negative results but by merely acknowledging the risks of generative AI to the business.\n \n\n\t\t\tLet\u2019s take a closer look at what happened in the European edtech ecosystem. Here are our five key takeaways.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tMy Tutor Source became the first MENA-based edtech startup to raise $100 million, which bodes well for the region\u2019s ecosystem, previously more dependent on U.S. and U.K.-based startups for edtech activity than homegrown companies. The remaining large deals of $80 million \u2013 $100 million tended to be companies raising later stage funding, like Degreed and Begin. One European deal made the top 10: Hack the Box\u2019s $55 million Series B (a Brighteye portfolio company).\nUsing this segue into Europe, the announced $1.7 billion privatization of Norway/U.K.-based Kahoot by a Goldman Sachs\u2013led group presents a bright start to H2 2023, with the compelling cash offer representing a greater than 10x multiple on revenue. The deal spotlights a trend we anticipated in our annual report in January \u2014 growing M&A activity as companies begin to favor exits over raising down rounds and risking becoming zombies.\nOverall, however, we expect a minor increase in European activity in H2 2023. H1 2023 saw increased funding than the previous period in H2 2022 and many of the companies that raised big rounds in early- to mid-2021 will be coming back to the table to raise more funding.\nThis should not be seen as signs of health in the ecosystem, however \u2014 what will be more telling will be:\n\nThe basis on which these companies are raising (to seize opportunities or to stay afloat).\nWhether these companies are raising more or less funding than their previous rounds.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at what happened in the European ecosystem. Here are our five key takeaways:\nOne-third of global edtech deals done in Europe\nIt\u2019s positive to see the European edtech market holding firmer than other major markets in North America and Asia in terms of deals activity, but activity by funding and deal count is down across the board.\nEuropean edtech has a larger portion of a smaller pie:\nEuropean edtech has a larger portion of a smaller pie.

Give the AI tool additional information, like the boilerplate from your last press release, the \u201cAbout\u201d section on your website, your company\u2019s social media profiles, or any other assets you already have.\nThere is no need to reinvent the wheel, so use content you\u2019ve already worked on to help generate better keywords, recommendations, and ultimately, your marketing strategy.\nAs we fed the AI system more information, the results formulated improved and the recommendations got better. Remember that AI is about training the data, so as you progress, the answers shared will become more and more accurate. The more data you provide the AI tool, the better it will understand your company and industry.\nUse targeted categories to create marketing content\nAfter using AI to highlight target keywords within your website as well as your industry, you can develop an SEO strategy guaranteed to help you secure a top spot in search results.\nOne of ChatGPT\u2019s best use cases is for content generation like blog ideas, titles, and website copywriting. Make sure to do this in the same ChatGPT thread you started with, as this is where you have trained the AI system. Here is a prompt you can use to get this going:",

        "content": "\nTo get a roundup of TechCrunch\u2019s biggest and most important crypto stories delivered to your inbox every Thursday at 12 p.m. PT, subscribe here.\nWelcome back to Chain Reaction.\nThe Paris-based Ethereum Community Conference, EthCC, happened this week and brought in more than 350 speakers and 5,000 attendees.\nWhile I wasn\u2019t able to make it to the largest annual European Ethereum-focused event, I kept a close eye on what was transpiring there from my NYC apartment so I can give TechCrunch readers a high-level overview and save them a couple thousand dollars on a trip to Paris (even though a vacation, I mean work trip, there does sound nice).\nHere are a few panels from some major organizations that caught my eye:\n\nEthereum\n\nVitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, dove into the history of account abstraction and how developers have been working on it, even before the layer-1 blockchain network launched. Buterin discussed the latest Ethereum Improvement Proposal, a change that could allow users to create non-custodial wallets as programmable smart contracts. If successful, this upgrade could potentially improve global web3 adoption by making crypto wallets as easy to use as an email account.\n\n\na16z\n\nWeb3 has the potential to fix social media and consumer applications, Sriram Krishnan, general partner of a16z crypto, said during a keynote presentation. He believes now is the time to build \u201clarge-scale crypto consumer social media marketplace applications.\u201d\nChris Lyons, general partner of web3 media at a16z, talked about \u201chiding the wires\u201d and how that can be the biggest opportunity in crypto to grow to 100 million users.\n\n\nReddit\n\nMirela Spasova, Reddit\u2019s senior engineer manager for collectible avatars, shared the platform\u2019s primary mission to onboard millions of users into digital collectibles, like it did last year. Today Reddit has onboarded more than 8 million users to its wallets and digital collectibles and made over $1 million in revenue for 30 to 100 creators, she noted.\n\n\nChainlink\n\nSergey Nazarov, Chainlink co-founder, discussed Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which recently launched on mainnet on the Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon blockchains. The launch of CCIP aims to focus on creating a \u201csecure and reliable internet of contracts,\u201d Nazarov noted. \u201cThe better the applications you build, the more attractive this whole blockchain thing will be, for all the people with money whether they\u2019re big banks, individuals or asset managers.\u201d\n\n\nCoinbase\u2019s Base\n\nJesse Pollak, lead for Base and head of protocols at Coinbase, talked about the layer-2 blockchain\u2019s plan to become decentralized. \u201cIf you look at the pre-internet area, if you were a developer you had a hard time building products for the world.\u201d Then the internet came around and opened up the ability to build applications, Pollak said. The online era will be replaced by the onchain worlds through blockchain technology, Pollak believes. \u201cNow we\u2019re on the precipice of that changing with us moving from an online platform to an onchain platform.\u201d\nAlso next week, Optimism, an Ethereum-focused layer-2 project, will release an \u201copen neutrality framework\u201d with a focus on decentralization guidelines, Pollak said, and Base will follow it, too. The framework plans to provide principles for networks that aim to be decentralized.\n\n\nAave\n\nStani Kulechov, CEO of Aave Companies, announced the launch of Lens Protocol V2, an upgrade to the web3 product aimed at creating a decentralized social networking ecosystem. The new iteration will have upgrades like \u201copen actions\u201d that connect onchain elements to social content so web3 experiences can become social ones, Kulechov noted. \u201cEffectively we\u2019ll have an internet that benefits all and people-powered social networks where you\u2019ll have a say in how the network will evolve in the future.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis week in web3\n\nSome VCs are turning away from crypto, but CoinFund is diving deeper with latest $158M fund\nRipple\u2019s XRP case \u2018underscores the need for regulatory clarity\u2019\nCrypto is known for financial use cases, but how can it grow from there?\nGnosis launches Visa card that lets you spend self-custody crypto in Europe, soon US and Hong Kong\nCrypto winter is showing market maturity compared to previous downturns, Electric Capital GP says\n\nThe latest pod\n\nOn our latest episode, Jacquelyn interviewed Maria Shen, a general partner on the investment team at Electric Capital, an early-stage venture firm focused on crypto, blockchain, fintech and marketplaces.\nBefore Electric Capital, Maria was the CTO and co-founder of Bambify, a startup that helped small to medium-sized businesses create more efficient supply chains with manufacturers globally. Prior to that, she worked at Microsoft.\nIn March 2022, the firm announced that it closed $1 billion for a pair of crypto funds \u2014 a $400 million vehicle for making equity investments in startups and a $600 million fund intended to invest directly in crypto tokens. Its website currently showcases a portfolio with about 75 investments with crypto startups like Magic Eden, ConsenSys and Bitwise, to name a few.\nMore recently, Electric Capital put out a report that showed the number of blockchain developers in the U.S. has declined every year since 2017, dropping to 29% last year from 40% in 2017. We dove into what that report really means and how it will affect the growth of developers domestically and internationally.\nWe discussed which crypto sectors Maria is watching for investments, why she\u2019s betting big on NFTs and the general venture capital market sentiment.\nWe also talked about:\n\nU.S. regulatory impact on investments\nThe bear market\nTrends she\u2019s following\nAdvice for founders\n\nSubscribe to Chain Reaction on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or your favorite pod platform to keep up with the latest episodes, and please leave us a review if you like what you hear!\nAlso check out Jacquelyn as a guest on Boys Club, where she dives into her backstory, what it\u2019s like covering crypto, the state of the industry, trends she\u2019s following and more.\u00a0\nFollow the money\n\nP0x Labs, the team behind Mantra Network, raised $25 million at $500 million valuation\nBinance Labs invested $10 million into lending and borrowing protocol Radiant Capital\nRISC Zero raised $40 million to bring blockchains more advanced cryptographic tools\nWeb3 infrastructure provider Cosmic Wire raised $30 million in a seed round\nAI and metaverse-focused Futureverse raised $54 million in a Series A round\n\nThis list was compiled with information from Messari as well as TechCrunch\u2019s own reporting.\nWhat else we\u2019re reading\nWant to branch out from the world of web3?

        "title": "Few Americans think NASA\u2019s top priority should be sending humans to the moon or Mars",
        "content": "The majority of Americans think it is \u201cessential\u201d that the U.S. remain a global leader in space, but that private markets won\u2019t ensure enough progress on their own, according to new polling data from Pew Research Center.\nPew asked more than 10,000 American adults about their attitudes toward commercial space, NASA, the global space race and the outlook on space over the next 50 years. The poll comes at a time of major transformation in the space industry: rocket launches are now commonplace, space tourism is getting on its feet and NASA\u2019s Artemis program is advancing toward its second mission.\nNotably, few Americans (just 12%) said sending astronauts to the moon or Mars should be among NASA\u2019s top priorities. Instead, 60% said one of the top priorities should be asteroid monitoring, and five-in-10 said NASA should focus on monitoring Earth\u2019s climate. This stands in sharp contrast to how Congress intends to allocate the space agency\u2019s funding for the next fiscal year, with lawmakers actually looking to increase the amount of funding earmarked for Artemis and related programs, while putting science missions on the chopping block.\nMost Americans \u2014 65% \u2014 maintain that NASA should play a key role in space exploration, even as private companies play a larger role in the overall space ecosystem. This view is virtually unchanged since Pew last posed the question in 2018.\nImage Credits: Pew Research Center (opens in a new window)\nEven still, Americans\u2019 views on private space companies are overall positive, though many respondents were unfamiliar with them. For example, in the four areas Pew asked about \u2014 building rockets and spacecraft; making important contributions to space exploration; opening up space travel to more people; and limiting space debris \u2014 40-50% of respondents said they were not sure.\nOf those that said they were very familiar \u2014 two-in-10 respondents said they had heard a lot about private space companies \u2014 they reported being especially positive in their evaluations of the companies.\nIn other areas, particularly those concerning the shape of the space industry 50 years out, Americans mostly diverge. For example, while 55% of Americans predict space tourism will be routine by the year 2073, 44% disagree. Similarly, 26% of respondents said private space companies are doing a mostly bad job at limiting orbital debris, while an almost equal amount, 21%, say they are doing a mostly good job. (53% responded as not sure.)\n",

        "content": "Imagine running a large public company \u2014 S&P 500 large \u2014 and telling some of your most promising customers that you can\u2019t sell them what they want unless they\u2019re willing to wait three to five years at a minimum. In some cases, the wait might be as long as a decade.\nMore likely than not, those customers would find someone else to give their money to.\nThat is what\u2019s happening today at large electric utilities across the U.S., according to a new report in The Wall Street Journal. Of all the companies that should be eager to embrace the electric transition, electric utilities would seem to be at the top of the list. Yet they also appear to be some of the most hesitant.\nThe problem is particularly pressing in California, where the next couple decades will see the state phase out fossil fuel vehicles. Most of the replacements will be electric, which means that utilities should see an easily anticipated surge in demand, something most businesses would welcome.\nFor now, utilities are probably happy to sell a few extra kilowatt-hours. There aren\u2019t enough EV owners yet to require large amounts of new investment. And where available, most EV owners time their charging sessions to take advantage of low prices that some utilities offer. Plus, a slew of startups like WeaveGrid have cropped up to help utilities smooth some of the spikes that can occur when too many EVs get plugged in around the same time.\nBut as more vehicles get plugged in and zero-emissions deadlines grow nearer, it\u2019s clear that many utilities aren\u2019t prepared for what\u2019s to come.",

        "content": "Instagram\u2019s Threads\u2019 time at the top of the App Store has come to an end, thanks to an AI photo editing app called Remini that\u2019s going viral on TikTok. First launched in 2019, the app added a generative AI feature last year which TikTok users have recently discovered allows them to create professional headshots for sites like LinkedIn just by uploading their own selfies.\nIn one video by TikTok user @Gracesplace, for example, the creator shows off how she submitted selfies to create a handful of professional-looking headshots that shows her in different outfits and poses. The video has since blown up on TikTok, now topping 42.9 million views.\n\n@gracesplace #CapCut #ai #remini #fyp\u30b7 \u266c 3:15 (Slowed Down + Reverb) \u2013 Russ\n\n\nAs others replicated her experience, demand for the AI photo app sent it soaring into the No. 1 Overall position on the U.S. App Store on July 11th, overtaking Instagram Threads only days after Meta\u2019s popular new Twitter competitor launched, according to data from app analytics firm Apptopia. Over the past 30 days, Remini has seen 22+ million worldwide downloads. As of yesterday, the firm estimates the app was seeing over 20 million daily active users.\nAnother analytics firm, data.ai, saw Remini take over Threads on July 10th. In the U.S., Remini saw 2,131,000 U.S. downloads across iOS and Android in the past 10 days, it also found. From June 9-15, data.ai estimates Remini made $3,730,000 in consumer spending, a 1,055% week-over-week increase.\nOn the U.S. App Store, Remini has a 4.6-star rating across 124,000 reviews.\nTo create the AI headshots, users have to first pick eight to 12 photos of themselves, including close-up selfies featuring a variety of backgrounds, expressions and face angles, and then select their gender. You\u2019ll pick out a \u201cmodel\u201d image that shows the overall style and composition of the photos you want generated. To generate professional shots, there are a number of options available under the subheading \u201ccurriculum,\u201d but other styles are available, like \u201ctrendy,\u201d \u201ctravel,\u201d \u201ccasual\u201d and the questionable \u201cKorean aesthetic,\u201d among others.\n\nThe AI will take several minutes to generate the shots. When complete, you can swipe left and right as you view the results \u2014 similar to how you like or dislike your possible matches on Tinder.\nThis process is reminiscent of another AI photo app that also went viral on TikTok last year: Lensa AI, which used your own photos to create \u201cmagic avatars\u201d \u2014 or artistic renderings of users\u2019 own images. However, that app raised alarm with artists who said the app was using their art as its training data. In addition, users found they could generate NSFW images with the AI.\nSimilar to Lensa AI, Remini\u2019s app is also a free download, but using its full set of features requires a subscription. Currently, it\u2019s priced at $9.99/week or $79.99 per year. (Likely, some users have been working around the payment requirement by starting a free trial, generating their AI images, then canceling their subscription.)\nAs the Remini headshots trend blew up on TikTok, some users were unhappy with the app\u2019s AI results. Many people found the app was making unwelcome adjustments to their bodies in the resulting photos. For instance, some women remarked the app was making them much skinnier while others noticed it was greatly enhancing the size of their breasts or cleavage.\n\u201cAll I wanted were some linkedin head shots [sic],\u201d wrote TikToker @juliak528 in her video. \u201cWhy did AI give me a boob job,\u201d the video description read, followed by crying emojis.\n\u201cNo one talks about how dangerous this AI trend is for your mental health and body dismorphia [sic],\u201d noted TikToker @spookyhorrorqueen, commenting on how the AI was returning photos showing a differently-sized body.\n\u201cThe viral AI headshot filter made me about 105lbs and just\u2026its bad,\u201d added another creator, @northstarnotes, after the AI photos made her body smaller.\nOthers, however, said they were using their AI \u201cskinny\u201d photos as weight loss motivation.\nMilan-based Remini was not immediately available for comment regarding whether it was working to address the mistakes the AI was making. After publication, the company shared the following information: that it had seen 40 million downloads from July 2-15, for starters. In addition, the company addressed the issues with the AI, saying:\nWe believe an important reason why Remini has been so successful is that it gives users the ability to truly recognize themselves in the AI-generated photos. While we know this is true in the vast majority of cases, on some occasions, the body types in AI photos are not an exact representation of the user\u2019s body type \u2013 this isn\u2019t our intention. Should this occur, we encourage users to try and upload different selfies, or experiment with different reference images from our gallery. Guided by our internal testing and by the feedback of our users, we are continuing to refine our AI technology to minimize the chances of this occurring\nThere are other concerns with the app as well, as some users thought the AI results were good enough that it didn\u2019t make sense to pay a photographer for professional photos \u2014 something that speaks to the broader implications of easily accessible AI technology.\nAccording to Remini\u2019s website, generative AI photos of yourself aren\u2019t the app\u2019s only selling point. The app can also be used to restore old photos by adding detail, enhance face quality, improve the colors and tones of photos, enhance the background, and more. On the App Store, Remini also promotes it has the option to use an Official Barbie filter on your selfies, to turn your photos into those inspired by the new Barbie movie.\nUpdated, 7/21/23, 12PM ET with comments from Remini\n",

        "content": "Update: The custom instructions option has reportedly disappeared for some users. We\u2019re looking into it, but in the meantime don\u2019t be surprised if the function isn\u2019t available to you right now.\nOpenAI just launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don\u2019t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it \u2014 inputs like \u201cWrite the answer under 1,000 words\u201d or \u201cKeep the tone of response formal.\u201d\nThe company said this feature lets you \u201cshare anything you\u2019d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.\u201d For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so ChatGPT can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.\nWhile users can already specify these things while chatting with the bot, custom instructions are helpful if users need to set the same context frequently.\nThe instructions also work with plug-ins, making it easier for them to suggest restaurants or flights based on your location.\nOpenAI noted that the feature is available for Plus plan users, but it won\u2019t be available for people based out of the EU and the U.K. It is a beta feature for now.\nUsers can try out this feature on the web by clicking on their name and going to Settings > Beta features > Opt into Custom instructions. On iOS, users can access this through Settings > New Features > Turn on Custom Instructions.\nNotably, OpenAI says that the information given to the customize responses will be used to train its API models to adapt to different instructions.\n\u201cInformation from your use of custom instructions will also be used to improve model performance \u2014 like teaching the model how to adapt its responses to your instructions without overdoing it,\u201d the company said. However, users can opt out of this setting through their data control settings.\nOpenAI has been testing this feature with some users for a while now, as consultant Gavriel Cohen noted on Twitter. ChatGPT provides users with two boxes to specify their chat preferences where users can write about themselves and about the way they want to tune the chatbot\u2019s responses.\n\n\nSome examples of how they intend for it to be used pic.twitter.com/cpSw6oFy0G\n\u2014 Gavriel Cohen (@Gavriel_Cohen) July 12, 2023\n\nOnce users key in their responses, the changes will take effect starting with the next session. The company said the limit for responses is 1,500 characters.\nOpenAI said that the company uses its moderation API to scan customized instructions to check if they are unsafe in any nature. ChatGPT can refuse to save the instructions or ignore them if the responses resulted by those violate the company\u2019s policy. This is to ensure users don\u2019t type in instructions that lead to harmful or hateful answers from ChatGPT.\nIn May, OpenAI launched the ChatGPT app for iOS just for U.S.-based users. However, weeks after that announcement, the company expanded its availability to more than 40 countries. Last month, the startup launched an iPad app with support for Siri and Shortcuts. The company also added an option for users to search the web for answers through Bing from the ChatGPT app.\n",

        "content": "The list of mainstream Internet services that could shut down in the U.K. over security risks attached to government policymaking just got longer: The BBC is reporting Apple has threatened to shutter local access to its end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) comms services, FaceTime and iMessage, if minsters don\u2019t rethink a plan to further beef up existing (intrusive) surveillance powers.\nIn recent months we\u2019ve heard similar warnings from Meta-owned WhatsApp, Signal Messenger and Wikipedia in relation to other components of the U.K.\u2019s digital policy they view as harmful to their users\u2019 interests \u2014 so it\u2019s by no means the first warning that Brits could miss out on access to mainstream web services if ministers don\u2019t rethink their approach to tech policy.\nIn the case of Apple\u2019s latest warning, its target is government plans to further expand digital surveillance powers available to state intelligence agencies. Last month the Home Office announced a consultation on changes to a regime of notices that can be issued to comms providers to retain or intercept user data under the 2016 Investigatory Powers Act (IPA).\nAmong the changes being proposed by ministers is a requirement that messaging services clear security features with the Home Office before releasing them. They would also have to act immediately on a demand to disable security features \u2014 rather than, as currently, being able to wait until after a review of the request has been carried out and/or the outcome of any appeal made by the company.\nThe government argues the updates to the notices regime are necessary because \u201ctechnological changes risk having a negative effect on the capabilities of our law enforcement and intelligence agencies\u201d.\nAlthough it also claims it is \u201ccommitted to working with industry, and other relevant stakeholders, to develop reasonable proposals that will enable technology companies and government to continue to protect the public and their privacy, defend cyber security and human rights, and support technological innovation\u201d.\nSo called Technical Capability Notices \u2014 the instrument through which the U.K. state can, via the IPA, legally instruct comms providers to make changes to their services in order that state surveillance capabilities can function \u2014 were among the most controversial elements of the legislation, with concerns repeatedly raised that the law was unclear over whether comms providers could be ordered not to use E2EE.\nReached for a response to Apple\u2019s warning it could shut down FaceTime and iMessage if the government goes ahead with the planned changes to the IPA notices regime, a Home Office spokesperson sent this statement \u2014 which notes no decisions on how to update the powers have yet been taken:\nThe first job of government is to keep the country safe and investigatory powers are an essential tool for protecting our citizens.\nThe Investigatory Powers Act 2016 is designed to protect the public from criminals, child sex abusers and terrorists. With strong independent oversight, the Act regulates how intrusive investigatory powers by public authorities are used. We keep all legislation under review to ensure it is as strong as it can be and this consultation is part of that process \u2014 no decisions have yet been made.\nThe updated powers the government is proposing pose an increased security risk to web users everywhere, per Apple \u2014 which the BBC reports opposes requirements to inform the Home Office of any changes to product security features before they are released; and opposes taking action immediately if a notice to disable or block a feature is received from the Home Office, rather than waiting until after the demand has been reviewed or appealed against.\nApple also opposes a requirement for non-U.K.-based companies to comply with changes that would affect their product globally \u2014 such as providing a backdoor to E2EE, per the BBC. \nThe company also told the broadcaster it would not make changes to security features for one country that would weaken a product for all users. And pointed out that some changes would require issuing a software update so could not be made secretly. The BBC\u2019s report also quotes Apple describing the proposal as constituting \u201ca serious and direct threat to data security and information privacy\u201d that would affect people outside the U.K.\n\n\n\nWe haven\u2019t been able to confirm the substance of the BBC\u2019s reporting with Apple which did not respond when we contacted it with questions about the story. However the tech giant recently elected to brief the broadcaster on its displeasure at another piece of (incoming) U.K. digital regulation \u2014 hitting out in a statement last month at the Online Safety Bill (OSB) as a risk to encryption.\nIn making critical remarks public Apple joined a number of major tech services that had already been warning over powers contained in the draft legislation they say could enable the Internet regulator to order platforms to remove strong encryption.\nOf particular concern is a government amendment last year that put the bill on a direct collision course with E2EE by proposing the regulator, Ofcom, should have powers to force platforms to scan messages for child sexual abuse content (CSAM) \u2014 which, in the case of E2EE services, would likely require they implement client-side scanning by default (or otherwise backdoor encryption).\nPrivacy and security experts have lined up to warn over the security risks of such an approach.\nAs have other E2EE comms providers, including WhatsApp and Signal \u2014 who have suggested they would either stop offering service in the U.K. or else wait to be blocked by authorities rather than comply with a law they believe will compromise the security of all their users.\nThe online encyclopedia Wikipedia is another high profile critic. It, too, has suggested it could exit the U.K. if the government doesn\u2019t rethink its approach.\nWikipedia\u2019s concern for its service focuses on measures in the OSB related to age-gating and content censorship \u2014 ostensibly for child protection \u2014 which its founder, Jimmy Wales, has attacked as being \u201cbad for human rights\u201d, \u201cbad for Internet safety and simply \u201cbad law\u201d.\n\u201cWe would definitely not age gate nor selectively censor articles under any circumstances,\u201d Wales told TechCrunch when asked to confirm Wikipedia\u2019s position on the legislation, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ve chosen to be blocked in China and Turkey and other places rather than censor Wikipedia, and this is not different.\u201d\nDespite the cavalcade of mainstream tech industry and expert criticism fired at the OSB ministers have \u2014 so far \u2014 only entrenched their position, claiming the legislation is a vital tool to fight CSAM and will also boost protections for children and other vulnerable web users.\nEven concerns raised by the director of the research group selected by the government for a technical evaluation of a handful of \u201csafety tech\u201d projects given public funding back in 2021, as part of a Home Office competition to develop technology which can detect CSAM on E2EE services without comprising privacy, does not appear to have given ministers pause for thought.\n\u201cThe issue is that the technology being discussed is not fit as a solution,\u201d Awais Rashid, professor of cyber security at the University of Bristol and director of the Rephrain Centre, warned in a university press release earlier this month. \u201cOur evaluation shows that the solutions under consideration will compromise privacy at large and have no built-in safeguards to stop repurposing of such technologies for monitoring any personal communications.\n\u201cNor are there any mechanisms for ensuring transparency and accountability of who will receive this data and for what purposes will it be utilised. Parliament must take into account the independent scientific evidence in this regard. Otherwise the Online Safety Bill risks providing carte blanche for monitoring personal communications and potential for unfettered surveillance on a societal scale.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s willingness to ignore OSB critics may boil down to popular support based on its framing of the legislation as a vital child safety intervention.\nOpposition to the bill within parliament has also been limited, with the opposition Labour Party broadly falling in behind the government to support the bill. Peers in the second chamber have also failed to respond to last minute calls to amend the legislation to ensure encryption is safe.\nFollowing a final debate in the Lords last night, the Open Rights Group issued a statement \u2014 warning there had been no progress in ensuring the bill could not compromise encryption:\nAs it stands, the Online Safety Bill will give Ofcom the power to ask tech companies to scan our private messages on the government\u2019s behalf. Despite having cross party support, the opposition withdrew an amendment that would at least ensure judges have oversight over these powers for government-mandated surveillance.\nThe government claims it will protect encryption but has still not provided detail about how this is possible if these powers are enacted. It is now left to tech companies, who may have to deal with notices asking them to weaken the security of their products.\nThe bill still has to pass through final stages which could include consideration of further amendments. But time is running out for the government to avoid a direct collision course with mainstream E2EE tech platforms. So far it\u2019s preferred the fudge of claiming Ofcom would simply never ask E2EE companies to break their encryption \u2014 without providing legal certainty by specifying that in the bill.\nThe government took a similarly fuzzy approach to encryption in the IPA \u2014 which did not make it explicitly clear whether the law was essentially outlawing comms providers from using E2EE by containing powers were they could be mandated to hand over decrypted data. So there is something of a pattern in U.K. tech policymaking, over the past several years, where it touches strong encryption.\nAs for the planned changes to further extend the IPA notice regime, it remains to be seen whether Apple\u2019s biggest threat yet \u2014 to yank FaceTime and iMessage out of the U.K. \u2014 gives government ministers cold feet or not.\nIntelligence agency surveillance powers aren\u2019t likely to be quite so easy to sell to the British public as populist claims to be clamping down on Big Tech to protect kids. But it\u2019s notable that the Home Office statement in response to Apple\u2019s threat cites catching \u201cchild sex abusers\u201d as one of the missions the IPA was designed for.\n\nSecure messaging apps line up to warn UK\u2019s Online Safety Bill risks web security\n\n\nAn encryption exodus looms over UK\u2019s Online Safety Bill\n\n\n\n\n",

New research shows that for some early-stage companies, it doesn\u2019t really make a difference.\nA new report from startup lender Capchase found that SaaS startups with between $1 million and $15 million of ARR saw nearly identical levels of growth, on average, over the last year regardless of whether they raised venture capital. The report looks at financials from 900 of Capchase\u2019s early-stage startup customers located in the U.S. and Europe and split 49% bootstrapped and 51% VC-backed.\nThe report found that venture-backed SaaS startups showed a 42.8% year-over-year growth from June 2022 through the end of May 2023, compared to bootstrapped companies, which saw 44% growth over the same time. The numbers are close, sure, but given that the venture-backed startups raised external capital, we can safely assume that they spent more to achieve what is effectively the same growth rate as their bootstrapped peers.\nCapchase co-founder and CEO Miguel Fernandez said he initially was surprised to see how similar the numbers were for both venture-backed startups and bootstrapped companies, but once he talked to some bootstrapped founders, it began to make more sense.",

While the bug itself is not newsworthy, the circumstances of how this bug was found and reported to Google are, to say the least, peculiar.\nAccording to a Google employee, the bug was originally found by an Apple employee who was participating in a Capture The Flag (CTF) hacking competition in March. But that Apple employee did not immediately report the bug, which at the time was a zero-day \u2014 meaning Google wasn\u2019t aware of the bug and no patch had been issued yet. The bug was instead reported by someone else who also participated in the competition, didn\u2019t actually find the bug themselves and wasn\u2019t even on the team that found the bug.\n\u201cThis issue was reported by sisu from CTF team HXP and discovered by a member of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) during HXP CTF 2022,\u201d the Google employee wrote.\nAfter this story first published, TechCrunch viewed a Discord channel where someone claiming to be the Apple employee who originally found the zero-day explained their side of the story, particularly the reason why they didn\u2019t report the bug immediately, in response to Sisu, the person who reported the bug to Google.\n\u201cIt took me 2 weeks working on it full time to root cause, write [the] exploit [Proof of Concept] and writeup the issue such that it can be fixed,\u201d the person, who goes by Gallileo, wrote on July 6.\n\u201cIt was reported on June 5th, through my company. Yes it was late, there are multiple reasons for that. I first had to find the person responsible, the report had to be signed off by people and then the person responsible was OOO. It\u2019s commendable that chrome decided to fix it asap, but I think there wasn\u2019t any real urgency.

The person, whose name is not disclosed in the report, said they decided to report it even if they didn\u2019t find it themselves because they were \u201cnot 100% sure it was reported to the chromium team.\u201d\n\u201cSo I wanted to be safe,\u201d the person wrote.\n\u201cSince you are the one disclosing this issue and there are no duplicates, it seems that the team that discovered this issue has chosen not to disclose it to us?\u201d the Google employee wrote in another comment to the bug report.\nThe bug was fixed on March 29, according to the bug report. Google decided to award $10,000 as a bug bounty to the person who reported it, who, again, was not the one who found it.\nUPDATE, July 20, 2:30 p.m. ET: This story was updated to include Discord messages posted by the person who claims to have found the bug originally.\nUPDATE, July 24, 12:09 p.m. ET: Added clarification on twelfth paragraph.\nUPDATE, July 24, 12:017 p.m. ET: On Friday, Sisu, who identified as Martin Radev, and is the person who first reported the bug to Google, published a timeline explaining his side of the story. Radev said that the Apple employee reported the bug in June. They also said they are in touch with the Apple employee to figure out what to do with the $10,000 bounty they received from Google.

        "content": "Amazon might have the monopoly on physical goods sold online. But what about digital ones?\nThere\u2019s Steam for games and software. Shopify supports some forms of digital goods, like artwork and gig services. But three co-founders, Steven Schwartz, Cameron Zoub and Jack Sharkey, believe there\u2019s room for competition.\nSchwartz, Zoub and Sharkey are the creators of Whop, a marketplace for people to sell access to digital products. Products for sale \u2014 and re-sale \u2014 run the gamut from sports gambling picks and deals on food, travel and credit cards to tips to \u201clevel up your social game.\u201d\n\u201cWhop is a comprehensive online platform aimed at connecting sellers and buyers within the digital economy,\u201d Schwartz told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cIts mission is to centralize all products on the internet, offering a one-stop solution for anyone looking to participate in the digital economy.\u201d\n\nZoub and Schwartz met when they were 13 years old in a Facebook group over a shared interest in limited-edition sneakers. Together, they launched one of the first \u201csneaker bots\u201d \u2014 software to get shoes before they sold out \u2014 and used the profits to bootstrap the creation of more software to sell online.\nAfter teaming up with Sharkey, a software developer, to build products for small businesses, Zoub and Schwartz created a makeshift marketplace where people could buy software \u2014 and sell their own \u2014 for free. But scammers overran it.\n\u201cIt was trash,\u201d Schwartz said bluntly. \u201cPeople had to make forum posts and often got scammed, a middleman was required and pricing for the software wasn\u2019t clear.\u201d\nSo Schwartz, Zoub and Sharkey began working on an improved version of the marketplace, which became Whop.\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating a new economy, giving people new things to sell,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cWe see ourselves as competing with social media, where people have traditionally gone to sell their software, but suffer through an incredibly suboptimal experience.\u201d\nWhop\u2019s online marketplace for digital goods and services selling. Image Credits: Whop\nGiven the countless goods and services marketplaces out there, one might wonder what makes Whop \u2014 besides the amusing name \u2014 different. (This writer did.) Schwartz claims that Whop is differentiated by its selling experience and product discovery engine.\nSellers on Whop get a dashboard with promotion and customer relationship management tools as well as analytics for business insights. As for buyers, they\u2019re treated to a recommendation algorithm, visualizations for discovering new products and a portal for managing their purchases.\nSound par for the course? Perhaps. But Whop\u2019s going after a different audience than your typical marketplace: influencers and content creators.\n\u201cPeople are selling sponsorships or ad space on traditional social channels, but now they can use Whop to offer their audience a real, living and breathing product that they can collect a recurring, stable income stream on,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cIf someone has a million followers, they think they\u2019re better off continuing to post content, but in reality, someone who has 20,000 followers with a real product is actually making more money than them.\u201d\nIs there truth to that last statement? Perhaps. What does appear to be a trend is that buyers are more likely to buy a product that\u2019s recommended to them by an influencer they trust. According to one source, 49% of consumers depend on influencer recommendations, while 40% say that they\u2019re likely to purchase something after seeing it on Twitter, YouTube or Instagram.\nIn my cursory browsing, a lot of Whop\u2019s listings seem to revolve around sports betting, crypto and general wealth-growing strategies. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, necessarily. But I wonder if it all has staying power \u2014 and how carefully it\u2019s moderated.\nWhop provides analytics to sellers on the backend. Image Credits: Whop\nAs with all marketplaces, there\u2019s a risk, also, that bad actors manipulate the platform to drive sales to scammy products \u2014 whether through fake reviews or dubious SEO practices. Whop says that it takes steps to mitigate this, but it\u2019s tough to know how extensive those steps are, particularly considering Whop\u2019s small team (20 people).\nBut investors see potential in what Whop\u2019s doing. The company today announced that it raised $17 million in a Series A round with participation from Insight Partners, The Chainsmokers, Peter Thiel and others. The tranche values the startup at over $100 million \u2014 a healthy valuation for a marketplace of around a million customers and 3,000 sellers that\u2019s done $100 million in transactions to date.\n\u201cWe have loads of runway,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cThe pandemic and slowdown in tech have been incredible for us; the slowdown in venture in particular has resulted in numerous small-scale, cash-focused products, which is exactly what our product supports.\u201d\n",

        "content": "Reddit\u2019s r/place is one of the most oddly inspiring events on the internet, as diverse communities from across the platform come together to paint together on the same massive digital canvas. But amid ongoing controversy over Reddit\u2019s changing API prices, which put many indie developers out of business, this year\u2019s r/place serves as an opportunity for Reddit users to continue their ongoing rebellion.\nThe origin of r/place dates back to 2017, when then-Reddit engineer Josh Wardle created it as an April Fools\u2019 Day event (yep, that\u2019s the same guy who made Wordle!). On a canvas of one million pixels, any registered Redditor can place one single colored pixel every five minutes. So, individual subreddits will work together to make their mark on the massive, collaborative art piece \u2014 in the past, we\u2019ve seen giant Brazil flags, pixel-perfect recreations of the Mona Lisa, innumerable rainbows, and Pizza Johns that stare into your soul. The project came back for a second time in 2022, attracting almost 11 million users, so Reddit decided to bring r/place back again this year. The event was scheduled for June 23, but it was delayed, because at the time, numerous subreddits had shut down to retaliate against API changes.\n\u201cSo what they are saying is that they have fucked up so bad that they are going to try to distract us with r/place,\u201d one Redditor commented on the announcement.\nFollowing Twitter\u2019s (also controversial) lead, Reddit announced in early June that it would start charging developers for access to its API, which limits the community\u2019s ability to create plug-ins and features that make Reddit more accessible and enjoyable. Christian Selig, developer of the popular iOS client Apollo, said that it would now cost him $20 million per year to keep his app online, so at the end of June, he shut it down for good. Other apps like Sync for Reddit, BaconReader and Boost for Reddit have shut down too, while the developers for\u00a0Relay,\u00a0Now for Reddit\u00a0and\u00a0Narwhal decided to start charging subscriptions. Not everything on the internet can be free, but these resources have been such a core part of Reddit for so long that these changes can feel like a slap in the face.\nInstead of listening to the community, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman \u2014 known as u/spez on the site \u2014 doubled-down in defense of the API changes. Redditors see him as a representation of how Reddit has changed for the worse, so now, r/place is covered with messages that say \u201cfuck spez.\u201d At the time of publication, there are around 50 different variations of \u201cfuck spez\u201d on r/place (\u2026 and within another 15 minutes or so, a few of those messages were covered up with a rainbow \u201cDICKS\u201d). A German community got particularly creative, writing \u201cu/spez ist ein hurendsohn,\u201d which roughly translates to \u201cu/spez is a son of a bitch.\u201d Ouch.\nThe canvas changes quickly, and it will likely be unrecognizable by the end of the project. But so far, r/place is sending a clear, unified message that the user base of Reddit isn\u2019t happy with Huffman\u2019s leadership. Even within these protesting groups, there are divisions \u2014 some people want to paint the whole canvas black, and have begun their efforts in what they are calling \u201cthe black hole.\u201d Others are on the \u201cfuck spez\u201d train. And some people think that simply engaging in r/place is giving the Reddit executives what they want, which is more and more clicks on their site.\nImage Credits: Reddit\nIt\u2019s not likely that any amount of \u201cfuck spez\u201d-es will change Huffman\u2019s mind about Reddit\u2019s API pricing. But at the very least, these efforts show that users aren\u2019t willing to back down just yet.\n\nReddit braces for life after API changes\n\n",

        "content": "Benjamin, 44, has a place by the park in an up-and-coming area of downtown Dallas, Texas. He seems to keep to himself and eschews social media. Dulce, 42, lives nearby in a gated community lined with streets of terraced houses and grassy lawns in adjoining Fort Worth.\nThey look like small business owners making modest incomes working online. But the two bring in huge sums of cash by selling access to TheTruthSpy, a collection of Android so-called \u201cstalkerware\u201d surveillance apps, including Copy9 and MxSpy, which have compromised hundreds of thousands of people\u2019s phones around the world.\nBenjamin and Dulce are among a wider network of Americans selling the phone spyware, whose involvement helps to conceal the company behind their development, a Vietnam-based startup called 1Byte.\nOther than selling the same apps and living close to each other \u2014 something that looks like an unlikely coincidence \u2014 Benjamin and Dulce share nothing else in common, except one critical thing: The two sellers exist only on paper.\nFor years, TheTruthSpy brought 1Byte tens of thousands of dollars in monthly PayPal transactions from customers. But its rising popularity brought new problems. Selling spyware is fraught with legal and reputational risks, especially in the United States, where the startup saw growing demand for TheTruthSpy. PayPal\u2019s systems would periodically flag transactions and limit access to the spyware maker\u2019s accounts and funds. Customers also wanted to pay by credit card, but that would require the startup to fill out stacks of applications and paperwork that would have outed the operation.\nA TechCrunch investigation based on hundreds of leaked documents can now reveal how the spyware operation evaded detection, and for so long \u2014 details which have not been previously reported.\nFrom its software house in Vietnam, 1Byte devised a network of fake identities with forged American passports to cash out customer payments into bank accounts they controlled. It seemed like the perfect scheme: This stateside expansion allowed the startup to keep its identity a secret while making at least $2 million in customer payments since 2016. And the fake sellers would take the heat if the authorities discovered, seized or shuttered the operation. (Not that the feds would find them, since they claimed to live at phantom addresses.)\nThe scheme exploited weaknesses present in tech and financial system safeguards against fraud, like \u201cknow your customer\u201d checks for verifying a person\u2019s identity, which are designed to block organized crime gangs and money launderers from opening fraudulent accounts or moving funds using forged or stolen documents.\nLast year, TechCrunch was sent a huge cache of files that had been taken from TheTruthSpy\u2019s servers. The files included TheTruthSpy\u2019s master database, containing a record of every compromised device past and present \u2014 close to 400,000 victims \u2014 up to the day the database was exfiltrated. TechCrunch used the data to build a free lookup tool to allow anyone to check if their phone was compromised.\nThe leaked data we\u2019ve seen also reveals the inner workings of 1Byte\u2019s global surveillance ring. The data lays bare years of 1Byte\u2019s financial spreadsheets and customer transactions, including the individuals who purchased the stalkerware. TechCrunch has seen completed paper applications that the startup used for applying to credit card processors, filled in with the falsified personal information of sellers who do not exist. We\u2019ve also seen their forged government IDs \u2014 passports, driver licenses and Social Security cards \u2014 and utility bills of about a dozen or so manufactured identities.\nIt was through this intricate system of fake identities that the stalkerware maker funneled millions of dollars of illicit customer payments into its bank accounts.\nOn paper, Benjamin and Dulce look like regular Americans. TechCrunch has seen photos of their open and signed passports, utility bills with account numbers and electricity usage, and copies of their Social Security cards bearing their signatures.\nBut any more than a cursory look and the sellers\u2019 identities fall apart. Benjamin\u2019s passport photo was scraped from a Vietnamese photographer\u2019s website. The photos in Dulce\u2019s driver license and passport used heavily photoshopped faces of real people, perhaps to defeat any future facial recognition checks. And the number on Dulce\u2019s signed Social Security card belongs to a man who died in 1978.\nThe money-makers\nFor almost a decade, Dulce and Benjamin were two of 1Byte\u2019s biggest money makers, generating the spyware startup a small fortune.\nIn the early years, 1Byte relied on PayPal to process payments for customers buying TheTruthSpy. Customers would buy the software through the checkouts of the startup\u2019s many branded spyware websites, and PayPal would handle the rest. The money would flow into PayPal accounts in Dulce and Benjamin\u2019s names, which were actually under 1Byte\u2019s control.\nDulce\u2019s account netted $239,000 in 2016 and $886,000 in 2017 from selling TheTruthSpy through PayPal alone, according to tax documents that PayPal issued for those years. All the while, Benjamin consistently made tens of thousands of dollars every month selling the other cloned stalkerware apps \u2014 Copy9 and MxSpy \u2014 through PayPal.\nThese were by no means small sums, but 1Byte knew there were limitations to relying on PayPal.\nA collection of notes written by the 1Byte employees running the accounts \u2014 which also leaked \u2014 show the spyware maker claimed access to at least a couple of dozen PayPal accounts to keep its money flowing. The operators would offer full-year subscriptions to customers in exchange for resolving disputes that might have otherwise caught the attention of PayPal\u2019s human moderators. One of the notes served as a guide that outlined the different ways to avoid raising PayPal\u2019s suspicion, such as \u201cmoving money too fast,\u201d \u201ctaking in too much money at one time\u201d and receiving money \u201cthrough different accounts so the funds are more dispersed.\u201d\nThe process largely worked. But the operators struggled to keep up with growing demand and had no way to process customer credit cards at scale.\nDeveloping and selling spyware is a risky business; it\u2019s no wonder that 1Byte wanted to distance its involvement from the operation it was running. Credit card processors tend to balk at allowing customers to buy goods or services that could result in the processors facing liability. Just like porn, drugs and firearms, spyware falls in a similar high-risk category. And PayPal, whose policies broadly prohibit customers from using its platform to sell software that facilitates illegal activity, could have at any time discovered and unraveled the whole operation.\nAnother note found in the leaked cache described the startup\u2019s predicament. The note is a copy of an email sent by John, who presents as an American businessperson living in California and appears to be intimately involved with 1Byte and the spyware operation. Like Dulce and Benjamin, John is a manufactured identity who serves as a front for 1Byte.\nIn the email, John says that he has partners \u2014 meaning 1Byte \u2014 who own some websites and their customers want to pay with cards. John explains that so far the websites used PayPal to process tens of thousands of dollars in payments a month. John offered kickbacks to his contacts who could help facilitate payments by credit card instead.\nSoon after, 1Byte found a way for customers to pay by credit card, and business boomed. The startup already had a dossier of forged identities with some provable success, why not use them again?\nImage Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch\nToward the end of 2017 into early 2018, the spyware maker had branched out from PayPal to smaller payment facilitators, like software reseller companies, which were known to work with customers selling riskier products but in exchange for charging the seller higher fees. (Credit card processors consider software a higher-risk product than something you can physically ship; such is the nature of selling intangible, digital products from developers who might have little or no reputation.) Notwithstanding the legalities of selling surveillance software, phone spyware is notoriously buggy and can draw a steady stream of customer complaints.\nSuccess did not always last long. Some payment processors wised up to the kind of software they were being used to sell.\n1Byte used Dulce\u2019s identity to sign a contract with a small European payment processor in January 2018, according to a copy of the signed document found in the leaked cache. The payment processor told TechCrunch that the third-party company it relied on to do \u201cknow your customer\u201d checks approved the spyware maker, since Dulce\u2019s fake documents failed to raise any alarms.\nBut the payment processor grew suspicious when they identified a pattern of new account sign-ups. This prompted it to freeze the infringing accounts before booting TheTruthSpy\u2019s money-making sock puppets from its service. Documents shared by the payment processor showed that the accounts it froze were linked to bank accounts in Vietnam run by 1Byte employees and its director Van Thieu.\nWhen 1Byte couldn\u2019t consistently depend on an outside checkout provider, it increasingly made efforts to rely on its own. The startup had already laid the groundwork to scale by building its own checkout website called Affiligate. By 2020, Affiligate was handling the majority of customer payments.\n1Byte set up Affiligate as an ostensible marketplace for app developers to sell their software. Behind the scenes Affiligate\u2019s sellers were largely fake identities set up by 1Byte employees to sell TheTruthSpy and its many cloned apps. The employees also created marketplace accounts using their own personal email addresses, presumably without a second thought to the poor security of the site they had themselves built since these email addresses also leaked.\nAffiligate was designed to look and feel like a legitimate software reseller marketplace to outsiders, while functioning as a real checkout service that could funnel customer payments for 1Byte\u2019s many stalkerware products into accounts it controlled. But like most businesses these days, Affiligate still had to rely on an outside company to handle the processing of credit cards for its customers.\nLike millions of other small businesses around the world, 1Byte relied on payments giant Stripe to facilitate the majority of its customer payments over the operation\u2019s lifespan, which continued as we reported this story. Stripe famously allows businesses to integrate its payment technology using just a few lines of code, which helped propel Stripe to become one of the world\u2019s biggest and ubiquitous global payments processors, peaking at a $95 billion valuation.\nBy setting up accounts and integrating Stripe\u2019s checkout code, 1Byte was able to process credit cards at scale.\nFor its many flaws, 1Byte was diligent in its record keeping and kept detailed customer transaction logs. The leaked logs reveal over 55,000 total customer transactions between September 2017 and November 2022, accounting for more than $2 million in spyware sales. TheTruthSpy was by far its biggest seller, bringing in almost 90% of 1Byte\u2019s revenue, with Copy9 and MxSpy trailing behind.\nAccording to the logs, Stripe processed the majority of the spyware operation\u2019s total transactions. The logs also included the web addresses for customers to view their receipts online after paying; those receipts are still viewable on Stripe\u2019s website to anyone with the web addresses. PayPal and the other smaller processors handled the fraction of remaining transactions, the logs show.\nAffiligate\u2019s customer checkouts stopped working shortly after we contacted Stripe for comment. Stripe declined to comment on specific accounts, citing company policy.\nPayPal said in a statement: \u201cWe regularly assess activity against our policies and carefully review actions reported to us, and will discontinue our relationship with account holders who are found to violate our policies. For privacy reasons, we cannot comment on specific accounts.\u201d\nThe Americans\nDulce and Benjamin were just two of many false American personas in 1Byte\u2019s dossier of identities that helped prop up the operation over the years: John in California; Alex in New York; Brian in Los Angeles; and Angelica, who shares a surname with Dulce and whose forged documents list an address nearby in Fort Worth, but nevertheless does not exist.\nTo pull it off, 1Byte used forged passports and driver licenses \u2014 and falsified proof of U.S. residency, like utility bills. The spyware maker also spun up dedicated and single-purpose email addresses that were used solely for establishing their merchant accounts, and set up \u201cburner\u201d disposable U.S. phone numbers, allowing the operators to trick U.S. companies into thinking they were dealing with real Americans.\nWe know that other identity documents, such as the U.S. passports, driver licenses, state IDs and a fake U.K. driver license, are forged because 1Byte kept copies of the original documents, and the forged replica, which has similar personal information but with an entirely different person\u2019s photo.\nBanks, credit card providers, software resellers and payment merchants are all responsible for performing due diligence on their customers to weed out identity fraud and money laundering on their networks. Yet forgeries that are good enough to fool a human are still bound to make it through.\nBut 1Byte was also sloppy. At least two of the Social Security numbers assigned to forged identities belonged to dead people. The two Social Security cards look numerically sequential but are both listed on the Social Security Death Index, a commercially available list of Social Security numbers whose deaths were reported to the U.S. government until early 2014. The Social Security Administration does not reuse Social Security numbers after a person dies.\nOf the other documents, some of the utility bills listed home addresses that do not physically exist. Several forged government documents had small but noticeable typos.\nWe also know that several of the merchant and payment processor agreements were signed by 1Byte employees using the names of the forged identities that they had created, including Dulce and Benjamin, thanks to a mistake the employees made.\nThe employees may not have noticed that the agreements they signed, photographed and submitted contained hidden metadata that revealed the precise location and timestamp of where and when the photos were taken. The metadata showed the agreements were signed and photographed at 1Byte\u2019s location in Vietnam.\nAnother photo showed a Vietnamese identity card belonging to 1Byte\u2019s director Van Thieu, which contained similar metadata showing it had been photographed from the same location in Vietnam.\nWhen reached for comment, Thieu acknowledged his past work with the operation but said he was no longer involved \u201cbecause I know it [spyware] is illegal in some countries.\u201d Thieu did not address his involvement with the operation since 2016 or how his personal information leaked. A short time later, TheTruthSpy\u2019s website displayed a notice saying it was no longer taking customers: \u201cThis kind of this product is not allowed in most countries, so we have decided not to sell this product anymore.\u201d\nThe handlers\nThe startup\u2019s obsessive documenting and meticulous note-taking also included one spreadsheet, a master list of who\u2019s who in the operation, both the real-world handlers and the fake identities they control.\nWe know they are real people because, unlike Dulce and Benjamin whose photos were scraped from the internet and sometimes modified, these real-world handlers are seen in photos holding up their passports to their faces \u2014 the common \u201cknow your customer\u201d request used by a human verifier to determine if a person\u2019s documents are real or not, since these photos are generally more difficult to fake. One of the photos shows a handler\u2019s older relative holding up her passport bearing the same surname.\nAnother handler, whose passport was stored on 1Byte\u2019s servers, has a YouTube channel with videos reviewing various stalkerware apps, including TheTruthSpy. One of the videos published by the handler demonstrating the spyware\u2019s capabilities inadvertently disclosed his home address after installing the location-grabbing app on a phone he owned.\nThanks to 1Byte\u2019s poor security practices and leaky servers, their role in the operation was exposed.\nImage Credits: Bryce Durbin / TechCrunch\nBut this was not 1Byte\u2019s only security lapse. A ransom note left on TheTruthSpy\u2019s server in August 2020 suggests the spyware operation was compromised by a ransomware attack. Either someone had accessed the spyware maker\u2019s servers, or worse, siphoned a copy of the vast trove of phone data for themselves.\nHow 1Byte made its millions from selling phone spyware was not just because of the dossier of forged identities, the broken financial system checks that failed to catch their fake documents or the handlers keeping the money flowing. TheTruthSpy was allowed to operate unimpeded for years from servers hosted under the noses of authorities in the United States.\nWhether by coincidence or convenience, just as the spyware maker had operated Dulce and Benjamin as if they lived in Texas, 1Byte also hosted the tens of terabytes of phone data \u2014 much of it derived from American victims \u2014 in Texas web hosting data centers.\nA web host called Codero housed TheTruthSpy\u2019s infrastructure and its huge banks of data as far back as 2017. Codero kept TheTruthSpy as a paying customer until February 2023, when Codero unceremoniously booted TheTruthSpy from its network, and for a time, off the internet. A Codero executive later told TechCrunch that the web host terminated TheTruthSpy for violations of its terms of service, but that it was prohibited from removing the spyware maker sooner, citing an ongoing federal investigation.\n1Byte scrambled to get back online from whatever backups it could use to recover, setting up shop at Hostwinds, another web hosting company with a nearby data center. At that point, the Codero executive emailed Hostwinds CEO Peter Holden to warn him that the \u201cbad actors\u201d had moved to his network. When reached by TechCrunch, Holden said Hostwinds terminated the client once it became aware of their operation.\n\u2014\nStalkerware and phone spyware is notoriously buggy. TheTruthSpy, even as an entire family of stalkerware, is just one of many spyware apps that have in recent years been hacked, spilled or otherwise compromised the masses of phone data that they collect. But TheTruthSpy\u2019s ability to find cover to operate freely, and for so long, allowed it to become one of the biggest known clandestine networks of compromised phones.\nSecurity researchers Vangelis Stykas and Felipe Solferini, who presented their research into several stalkerware networks at BSides London, found TheTruthSpy was still exposing hundreds of thousands of active accounts at the time of their talk in December 2022. Stykas and Solferini\u2019s research\u00a0\u2014 some of it unpublished and shared with TechCrunch, which proved crucial in reporting this story \u2014 confirmed that TheTruthSpy stalkerware network drains down to 1Byte as its ultimate developer and reseller.\nWhile the possession of spyware is not illegal, using it to record calls and private conversations of people without their consent violates both federal and several state laws. U.S. federal and state authorities have ramped up enforcement action against stalkerware actors in recent years, including banning notorious stalkerware app SpyFone and ordering spyware makers to notify their victims, yet overseas operators find themselves largely out of the jurisdictional reach of U.S. law enforcement.\nWhen reached before publication, the Federal Trade Commission said it does not comment on whether it is investigating a particular matter.\nBut for as long as TheTruthSpy stays on the internet, it poses a real and constant threat to the victims whose phones its spyware apps have compromised. Not just because of the data that it collects from thousands of victims\u2019 phones without their knowledge, but because it cannot keep that data from falling into the wrong hands.\n\nYou can use our free lookup tool to check if a phone was compromised by TheTruthSpy. We also have a guide on how to remove the spyware from your phone, if you believe it is safe to do so. Do note that removing the spyware may alert the person who planted it.\n\nYour Android phone could have stalkerware, here\u2019s how to remove it\n\n",

The expectation is that funding to such companies will reach its second-highest total ever this year.\nThat\u2019s a big deal, with PitchBook expecting the amount of capital allocated to mixed-gender teams this year to overtake last year\u2019s sum. H1 2022 saw companies with founders of both genders raise $26.8 billion; they subsequently closed out the year with a total of $43.3 billion raised, which holds the current record as the second-highest amount of capital allocated to mixed-gender teams. The first was in 2021, in which such companies raised $59.6 billion overall.\nMixed-gender teams picked up 28.1% of capital raised in H1, which is up from raising 16.9% in H1 2022.\nBut startups with all-women founding teams are struggling to raise money this year and have picked up only $1.4 billion in H1. That\u2019s $800 million in Q1 and $600 million in Q2. The last time companies with all-women founders raised such a low H1 amount was in 2017, when they picked up $1.2 billion. All-female-founded startups raised $3.1 billion in H1 2022, $4 billion in H1 2021 and even $1.8 billion in H1 2020.\nWith the venture market in retreat compared to prior highs, we need to understand how the ratio of capital raised by all-women-founded startups is evolving. All-women founding teams raised 1.6% of the capital allocated this H1, which is only a tad lower than H1 2022, when they picked up 1.9%. Regardless of the total amount all-women teams raise, the number rarely swings beyond 2%. It appears that the presence of a man on the team dramatically increases the amount of funding a woman founder receives.",

The company announced this morning the launch of Walmart+ Assist, a way to purchase a Walmart+ membership at 50% off ($49 per year, or $6.47 per month) for those on government assistance.\nTypically, a Walmart+ membership costs $98 per year or $12.95 per month, plus applicable taxes.\nThose on the Assist membership will still be able to utilize the full range of Walmart+ features and perks, which include free shipping on Walmart.com purchases with no order minimum (excluding most Marketplace items), free grocery delivery with a $35 order minimum, free returns from home (no printing or repackaging required), savings of 10 cents per gallon at 14,000 locations (including Exxon, Mobil, Walmart and Murphy stations), a free Paramount+ subscription, ad-free video streaming with Pluto TV, mobile scan & go in-store for contact-free checkout and other special offers and savings for members only, including early access to Black Friday deals.\nTo qualify, new and existing Walmart+ members must first visit Walmart.com/Plus/Assist to verify their eligibility through a third-party verification provider called SheerID. Customers will be taken to the SheerID website to fill out their eligibility form, then returned to the Walmart site or app to continue enrollment upon completion.\u00a0They can then sign up for the Assist membership at the discounted rate.\nWalmart\u2019s discounted program comes several years after Amazon announced a similar program for Prime members.\nIn 2017, Amazon debuted a low-cost version of Prime for those on government assistance, also bringing the cost down by about half. Amazon\u2019s program at launch supported those on a number of government assistance programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and Women, Infants and Children Nutrition Program (WIC).

Google reportedly believes that the tool can serve as a personal assistant for journalists by automating some tasks in order to free up time for others. The tech giant sees the tool as a form of \u201cresponsible technology.\u201d\nThe New York Times reports that some executives who were pitched on the tool saw it as \u201cunsettling,\u201d noting that it seemed to disregard the effort that went into producing accurate news stories.\n\u201cIn partnership with news publishers, especially smaller publishers, we\u2019re in the earliest stages of exploring ideas to potentially provide AI-enabled tools to help journalists with their work,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.\n\u201cFor instance, AI-enabled tools could assist journalists with options for headlines or different writing styles,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cOur goal is to give journalists the choice of using these emerging technologies in a way that enhances their work and productivity, just like we\u2019re making assistive tools available for people in Gmail and in Google Docs.

        "content": "North Korean state-backed hackers breached U.S. enterprise software company JumpCloud to target its cryptocurrency clients, security researchers said on Thursday.\nJumpCloud, a directory platform that allows enterprises to authenticate, authorize and manage users and devices, said this week that a nation-state actor was behind a June breach of its systems that forced the company to reset customers\u2019 API keys.\nWhile JumpCloud didn\u2019t at the time attribute the hackers to a particular nation, researchers at cybersecurity companies CrowdStrike and SentinelOne have today attributed the breach to North Korea-backed hackers called Lazarus, a well-known group known for targeting crypto entities such as the Ronin Network and Harmony\u2019s Horizon Bridge. Incident responders at Mandiant also attributed the hack to North Korea.\nCrowdStrike has linked the JumpCloud attack to \u201cLabyrinth Chollima,\u201d a sub-group of the notorious Lazarus hacking group that was also linked to the recent supply-chain attacks targeting enterprise phone maker 3CX. CrowdStrike senior vice president for intelligence Adam Meyers told Reuters that the hackers, which the cybersecurity company has been tracking since 2009 and describes as one of the \u201cmost prolific DPRK adversaries,\u201d has a history of targeting individuals related to the cryptocurrency sector. North Korea has a long history of using crypto-stealing operations to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons program.\nSeparately, SentinelOne researcher Tom Hegel confirmed that\u00a0indicators of compromise (IOCs) shared by JumpCloud are \u201clinked to a wide variety of activity we attribute to DPRK.\u201d Hegel said in a tweet he was \u201chighly confident\u201d in attributing the breach to North Korea, and said the hackers may have also been behind a recent social engineering campaign targeting GitHub customers.\nThe \u201clow-volume\u201d campaign targeted the personal accounts of employees of technology firms, GitHub said in a blog post last week, many of which are connected to the blockchain, cryptocurrency or online gambling sectors. GitHub attributed the targeting to \u201ca group operating in support of North Korean objectives,\u201d tracked as TraderTraitor by CISA.\n\u201cBased on public details available as of this writing, it\u2019s unclear if the GitHub alert originated from the JumpCloud incident or if they are separate efforts by the same attacker,\u201d Hegel said.\nMandiant, which is working with a customer that was compromised by the JumpCloud breach, confirmed on Thursday it \u201cassesses with high confidence\u201d that the hackers are a cryptocurrency-focused element within North Korea\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, or RGB. Mandiant said this hacking unit targets companies \u201cwith cryptocurrency verticals to obtain credentials and reconnaissance data.\u201d\nLater, JumpCloud confirmed CrowdStrike\u2019s findings and said fewer than five customers \u2014 and fewer than 10 devices \u2014 were compromised by the hackers. JumpCloud\u2019s software is used by more than 180,000 organizations, and the company has more than 5,000 paying customers.\n\u201cUpon detecting the incident, we immediately took action based on our incident response plan to mitigate the threat, secure our network and perimeter, communicate with our customers, and engage law enforcement,\u201d JumpCloud spokesperson Josie Judy told TechCrunch earlier in the day.\nIn May, U.S. officials announced new sanctions against North Korea\u2019s army of illicit IT workers, which they claim have fraudulently gained employment around the world to finance the regime\u2019s weapons of mass destruction programs. The U.S. State Department is also offering rewards of up to $10 million for information that could help disrupt North Korean hackers.\nUpdated with comment from Mandiant, and later with an update from JumpCloud.\n\nJumpCloud says nation-state hackers breached its systems\n\n",

These locations have included Amazon\u2019s own retail stores, including its Amazon Go convenience stores, as well as various sports stadiums, entertainment venues and travel retailers like Hudson, CREWS and OHM at several U.S. airports, in addition to Panera Bread through a partnership announced in March 2023.\nStadiums using the tech include Bridgestone Arena, Climate Pledge Arena, Globe Life Field, Lumen Field, T-Mobile Center, T-Mobile Park, NASCAR Raceway and Texas A&M\u2019s Kyle Field, along with entertainment venue Hollywood Casino at Greektown in Detroit and others.\nThe system has also been steadily rolling out to Whole Foods locations, ahead of today\u2019s announcement. Currently, Amazon One is available at over 200 Whole Foods Markets in the U.S., including in Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. It will now expand nationwide over the last half of the year.\nWith its expansion to Whole Foods, shoppers won\u2019t need to have their wallet or even their phone in order to make a purchase \u2014 they\u2019ll just use their palm to pay, explains Amazon. In addition, Prime subscribers who link their Amazon One profile with their Amazon account will automatically have savings applied as a membership perk.\nRecently, Amazon announced the reader would also be able to verify customers\u2019 ages, allowing customers to use the device to purchase adult beverages \u2014 like beer at a sports event \u2014 just by hovering their palm over the reader. Coors Field was the initial adopter of this version of the system, Amazon said in May. It\u2019s not clear if this part of the system will also work at Whole Foods or if customers will need to show their ID to store staff, as is common with most other self-checkouts.\nImage Credits: Amazon\nTo use the system, customers can pre-enroll via the web using their credit or debit card, Amazon account and mobile number in about a minute. Amazon has partnerships with American Express, Discover, Mastercard, Visa and other major U.S. banks, it says. Customers then complete their enrollment process the first time they scan their palm over the Amazon One device when visiting a participating Whole Foods location. They also can choose to register at an Amazon One device in the store, if they prefer.\n\u201cWe are always looking for new ways to delight our customers and improve the shopping experience,\u201d said Leandro Balbinot, chief technology officer at Whole Foods Market, in a statement about the expansion. \u201cSince we\u2019ve introduced Amazon One at Whole Foods Market stores over the past two years, we\u2019ve seen that customers love the convenience it provides, and we\u2019re excited to bring Amazon One to all of our customers across the U.S.\u201d\nAmazon insists that customer information is secure in its own AWS Cloud, where it\u2019s protected by multiple security controls. Plus, it notes it\u2019s not actually using the palm image to identify the customer, but rather a palm \u201csignature.\u201d That\u2019s determined by looking at the palm and underlying vein pattern to create a unique, numerical, vector representation for identity matching.\nOf course, Amazon\u2019s entry into biometric payments isn\u2019t only about speeding up checkout lines for customers\u2019 convenience. By combining biometrics with payment card information and Amazon accounts, the retailer has created a system that could track customers in both the online and offline world, then serve highly personalized ads and recommendations, which would boost its revenue.\nIn an earlier version of an Amazon One FAQ, however, the retailer claimed it \u201cdoes not use or sell customer information for advertising, marketing, or any other reasons.\u201d\nToday, a new FAQ clarifies its stance further, saying:\nAmazon One will never share palm data with third parties, under any circumstance, including in response to government demands, unless we\u2019re required to comply with a legally valid and binding order. Additionally, Amazon One is not interoperable with data provided by other sources. This is because Amazon One uses a proprietary combination of palm and vein imagery to recognize customers, making it unusable to third parties and unmatchable with data from other sources. Further, Amazon One palm data is not used by Amazon for marketing purposes, and it will not be bought by or sold to other companies for advertising, marketing, or any other reason. In fact, when you use Amazon One at third-party locations, Amazon doesn\u2019t track what you do or buy after entering the location. That data is not associated with your biometric identity, and we built Amazon One that way intentionally.\nDespite the retailer\u2019s assurances, Amazon One\u2019s technology has been the subject of privacy concerns since its launch, leading one early adopter to choose to abandon their plans to use the readers after receiving pressure from consumer privacy and advocacy groups. Denver Arts and Venues had once been planning to leverage Amazon One for ticketless entry at Red Rocks Amphitheater \u2014 which would have been a big win for Amazon \u2014 but it cut ties with the retailer after the publication of an open letter\u00a0that suggested Amazon could share palmprint data with government agencies and that it could be stolen from the cloud by hackers.\nA group of U.S. senators\u00a0also pressed Amazon for more information about its plans with customer biometrics in 2021 shortly after the technology\u2019s launch. More recently Amazon was reported to be facing a class action lawsuit\u00a0over failure to provide proper notice under an NYC biometric surveillance law, related to the use of its Amazon One readers at Amazon Go stores.\n\n\nAmazon\u2019s palm-scanning payment tech will now be able to verify ages, too\n\n",

        "content": "Gotta catch \u2019em all! Catch all those Zs, that is.\nNow available in the U.S., Pok\u00e9mon Sleep is an app that \u201cturns sleep into entertainment.\u201d Thankfully, the app does not imbue your brain with sonic waves that make you dream of Hypno, a Pok\u00e9mon that gave me vivid nightmares as a child. Instead, you simply place your phone next to your pillow while you sleep, and when you wake up, you can see how you slept.\nOf course, what differentiates this from the oodles of other sleep tracking apps is that there are Pok\u00e9mon involved. When you start the game, you meet Professor Neroli, a Pok\u00e9mon sleep researcher (we applaud the amount of funding available in the Pok\u00e9mon universe to support academics, but are nonetheless surprised that this field of study exists). He gives you some sort of sleep device to fill the plot hole we\u2019re all wondering about, which is how our human sleep is supposed to relate to the sleep of Pok\u00e9mon. It turns out that if you go to bed before your set bedtime, you get in-game rewards.\n\n\nMe before: 6 hours of sleep is plenty. I'm not a baby. I have shit to do\nMe since Pok\u00e9mon Sleep came out: *in bed at 10pm after taking 2 Mg tablets and drinking herbal tea* so if I set my alarm for 7am and only wake up once during the night, I can maximize my Drowsy Points\u2026\n\u2014 Cian Maher (@cianmaher0) July 20, 2023\n\nThis sounds like an app made by a sleep-deprived engineer whose kids love Pok\u00e9mon, but don\u2019t love going to bed at an appropriate hour. Unfortunately, when I was a kid, I probably would\u2019ve accepted Pok\u00e9mon rewards to go to sleep, so long as those rewards did not involve Hypno, who remains quite creepy in my book, but hey, at least Mimikyu didn\u2019t exist back in my day.\nAside from a partner Pikachu, you start off the game with a big ol\u2019 sleepy Snorlax. The more you sleep, the more \u201cdrowsy power\u201d your Snorlax gets, and that power helps you meet even more Pok\u00e9mon. If you connect a Pok\u00e9mon GO Plus \u2014 a device that connects to your phone to help you catch more Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon GO \u2014 you can get a Pikachu that has a sleeping cap. And then in Pok\u00e9mon GO, you\u2019ll get a Snorlax with a sleeping cap.\nThe app might seem like it came out of left field, but the Pok\u00e9mon Company has been promoting it for more than four years \u2014 at Pok\u00e9mon GO Fest events as early as 2019, you could catch Unown that spelled out \u201cSLEEP.\u201d\u00a0 But in practice, Pok\u00e9mon Sleep seems like an elaborate ploy to sell more Pok\u00e9mon GO Pluses and/or some Pok\u00e9mon engineers just got really creative in the pursuit to make their kids go to bed. If it works, though, go figure!\n\nPok\u00e9mon GO gets integration with Scarlet & Violet, plus Pok\u00e9mon Sleep update\n\n\nNiantic lays off 230 employees, cancels NBA and Marvel games\n\n",

        "content": "Not only are healthcare bills confusing, but also paper bills can often get lost in the mail or covered up in big piles on counters. Large healthcare organizations, for the most part, offer electronic billing, but that\u2019s not always something solo or small practices can take advantage of.\nThat is the sweet spot for Collectly, founded by Levon Brutyan and Max Mizotin, which aims to help medical providers more easily collect payments.\nOne report shows that the amount medical providers collected was about 55% of what they were owed in 2021, down from 76% the year prior.\n\u201cPatient payments overall have to be about $480 billion, and considering that the patient responsibility grows at about 12% year over year, this huge number increases as well,\u201d Brutyan told TechCrunch. \u201cThe bigger pain point for healthcare organizations is that approximately $200 billion of that never gets collected. Hospitals, for example, run on very tiny margins, and a lot of them are actually running at a loss, so that makes this whole thing even worse.\u201d\nPasadena-based Collectly has proprietary interfaces that integrate with electronic health records and practice management software to enhance patient billing operations.\nThrough its platform, customers have, on average, been able to increase patient collections for medical group partners by 75%, reduce the \u201cdays sales outstanding\u201d to 12 days from between 60 and 90 days, and achieve a 93% patient satisfaction score \u2014 important for retention, he added.\nWe\u2019ve followed Collectly since it launched in 2017 as a digital debt collection startup, and then again later that year after being part of Y Combinator, raising $1.9 million and refocusing on automating and streamlining billing operations as a patient financial engagement company.\nCurrently, Collectly has engaged over 300,000 patients daily and is growing revenue over 3x year over year. Brutyan touts its growth and the fact that the company \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any churn\u201d as reasons why investors were eager to supply the company with capital for additional growth.\nThe company closed on $29 million Series A in a funding round, led by Sapphire Ventures, that also included YC, Wayfinder Ventures, Burst Capital, Cabra VC and Davidovs VC. The new investment brings the total capital raised to $34.1 million.\nBrutyan declined to say what the company\u2019s valuation is with the new round; however, he did say that \u201cthe valuation has grown accordingly\u201d and is one of those \u201crare companies that was running for so long profitably and grew by ourselves. I think that investors appreciate that specifically during these interesting and tough times.\u201d\nHe intends to use the new funding on technology and product development and to double the team\u2019s size by the end of the year. The company will be rolling out new products around pre-service modules and in-person payments as well.\n\u201cWe are also looking at emerging technologies, like ChatGPT,\u201d Brutyan said. \u201cAI is highly leveraged, so we are working on that as well to make sure that the patients will receive the best experience, understand their bills and that questions are resolved in a timely manner.\u201d\n\nFintech\u2019s growing role in the healthcare revolution\n\n",

        "content": "More victims of the mass-hacks targeting users of MOVEit Transfer, a popular file-transfer application, are coming forward as the number of known impacted organizations reaches almost 400.\nU.S. cosmetics giant Est\u00e9e Lauder said in a statement that an unauthorized third-party \u201cgained access\u201d to some of the company\u2019s systems and obtained data, but did not share any further details \u2014 or publicly link the incident to MOVEit.\nThe Russia-linked Clop ransomware gang, which has taken credit for the MOVEit mass-hacks, said it stole gigabytes of company data plus Est\u00e9e Lauder archives. Separately, the company was also listed by another ransomware gang.\nOther victims to show up on Clop\u2019s leak site this week included the U.K. government\u2019s communications regulator Ofcom, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, or ComReg, the general communications regulator for Ireland.\nOfcom spokesperson Harry Rippon told TechCrunch that as the regulator confirmed last month, it believes that the personal data of 412 employees was downloaded during the attack. \u201cNo payroll data was breached,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cThis affected Ofcom employees who had changed their benefits or who were new joiners.\u201d Ofcom said it \u201chas not made any payment, as per advice from the National Cyber Security Centre.\u201d\nComReg declined to answer TechCrunch\u2019s questions.\nWhile Clop listed both Ofcom and ComReg on Tuesday, both organizations have since been removed from the leak site. The reason behind the removal is not known, but Clop claims it deletes government-related data that it steals.\nThis could also be the reason that U.S. government agencies impacted by the mass-hacks have not yet been listed. In a statement shared with TechCrunch last month, U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA said that \u201cseveral\u201d U.S. government agencies experienced intrusions related to the MOVEit breach. The U.S. Department of Energy confirmed that two of its entities were among those breached.\nWhile Clop appears to have backtracked on its threats to leak Ofcom and ComReg data, the gang is threatening to publish data stolen from consultancy giant Ernst & Young and stockbroker TD Ameritrade. The hacking group also published a huge cache of data allegedly stolen from British multinational professional services brand PwC\u2019s clients. PwC was first listed by Clop last month but at the time declined to answer TechCrunch\u2019s questions.\nIn a statement provided to TechCrunch this week, PwC spokesperson Mike Davis confirmed that the company is \u201cworking with impacted clients\u201d and no longer uses the MOVEit file-transfer platform. PwC declined to say how many clients had been impacted or what types of data had been stolen.\nClop also listed several other companies on its dark leak site, including a U.S. airline, a Canadian tech company and a U.K. payments cybersecurity firm. None of these companies responded to TechCrunch\u2019s questions.\nIt\u2019s unlikely that the number of organizations \u2014 or individuals \u2014 impacted by the MOVEit mass-hacks will be known for some time.\nAccording to the latest data from Brett Callow, threat analyst at Emsisoft, there are so far 381 known victims of the MOVEit attacks, impacting the personal data of almost 20 million individuals. However, he told TechCrunch that \u201cbased on the average number of individuals per breach and the number of orgs we know have been impacted but not yet confirmed, the potential total of individuals could be 85,955,498.\u201d\n\u201cBut, of course, there\u2019s lots of orgs we don\u2019t yet know about,\u201d Callow added.\n\nBanks, hotels and hospitals among latest MOVEit mass-hack victims\n\n",

        "title": "InDrive brings its \u2018bid-based\u2019 ride-hail app to the US",
        "content": "InDrive (formerly inDriver) is bringing a new type of ride-hailing app to South Florida. The startup operates a \u201cbid-based\u201d platform wherein passengers can name their own fare for a ride, and nearby drivers can accept, decline or counter the offer.\nAt a time when ride-hail customers are feeling squeezed by higher fares and drivers are classified as independent contractors but given no say over how much they charge for rides, such a business model can be attractive.\nInDrive officially launched in Miami, its first U.S. market, Thursday. The company says it has more than 175 million downloads and is present in 655 cities across 48 countries.\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of InDrive, it might be because the company has more of a presence outside the traditional Western world. Originally from Siberia, InDrive divested its Russian entity in July 2022 after Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine began in March that year. The company says it has no other plans for investment in Russia.\nInDrive\u2019s top markets are in Latin America (Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador) and Asia (Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Pakistan, India).\nIn February InDrive raised $150 million in debt financing from General Catalyst, and since then has been expanding aggressively into new territories. The company recently announced plans to expand to 15 new cities in Nigeria,\u00a0and has had a presence in Africa for years.\nSo why America, and why now? Adam Warner, U.S. country manager, told TechCrunch that InDrive\u2019s strong foothold in LatAm was one of the drivers for launching in South Florida, specifically Miami.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve really built our entire business model guided on freedom of choice,\u201d said Warner. \u201cOur pricing is not determined by some kind of computer program. It\u2019s really open for drivers and passengers to negotiate the price of each ride, while drivers are also not penalized for declining orders. So unlike my peers, we put the drivers and consumers first by bringing transparency and fairness to ridesharing.\u201d\nSounds great! What could go wrong?\nApparently a few things.\nA quick perusal of app reviews demonstrate a plethora of issues customers have had with the app and the service \u2014 issues that probably won\u2019t fly with an American audience.\nUber and Lyft, for all their questionable ethics, ensure reliable rides and service by hitting drivers with a combination of incentives and punishments for accepting or declining rides. InDrive has more of a conscience, but that could lead to longer wait times for riders or riders repeatedly getting canceled on.\nWarner said InDrive is working on its marketing push to get as many drivers signed up as possible so that if one driver cancels, there will be another waiting in the wings. One way the company is attracting drivers is by refraining from charging a commission from July 2023 to January 2024, meaning the drivers will take home up to 100% of each fare (subject to airport fees and highway tolls). InDrive\u2019s usual fee is around 10% of each ride. Uber and Lyft take 25%.\nThe company is also promising to maintain a minimum ride price of $10 in Miami. Today, InDrive has 5,000 drivers in South Florida signed up for launch.\nCustomers also complained about InDrive\u2019s customer service being sub-par when dealing with issues like frequent driver cancellations, or drivers changing up the agreed-upon fare at pickup. Warner said InDrive has customer service teams in Mexico and Malaysia (but crucially not in the U.S.) to deal with any issues that come up.\nInDrive has raised about $387 million in total, according to Crunchbase. That\u2019s not a small number, but compared to competitors, it does mean InDrive has had to stay lean, which can affect the quality of the product. Customers reviewing the app also complained that it was buggy, that ETAs were off and that drivers didn\u2019t always know how to get from A to B. Part of that last problem is because InDrive doesn\u2019t have its own proprietary mapping and GPS system, as its peers do, which Warner says is a huge cost.\n\u201cWe give the drivers the freedom of choice to be able to switch on their own mapping services,\u201d said Warner. \u201cWe\u2019re not heavily invested into that particular part of it. We rely pretty heavily on partnerships with Google Maps, Waze, Apple Maps, et cetera.\u201d\nIf InDrive wants to compete with the likes of Uber and Lyft, it\u2019ll have to get its customer service and app sorted. But that\u2019s not impossible, and InDrive isn\u2019t in a huge rush to take over the U.S.\nWarner said the company is focused on solving the transportation needs in South Florida first, and doing so in a way that\u2019s sustainable.\n\u201cInDrive is definitely open to expanding its footprint in the United States, really focusing on markets with insufficient mobility and public transportation options,\u201d said Warner. \u201cAlso markets that have high travel costs and emerging tourism.\u201d\nUpdate: InDrive now has 5,000 drivers signed up for launch. A previous version of this article had 3,500 drivers, which InDrive tells us is an outdated number.\n",

        "content": "Google continues the rollout of its Privacy Sandbox APIs \u2014 its replacement for tracking cookies for the online advertising industry. Today, right on schedule and in time for the launch of Chrome 115 into the stable release channel, Google announced that it will now start enabling the relevance and measurement APIs in its browser. This will be a gradual rollout, with Google aiming for a 99% availability by mid-August.\nAt this point, Google doesn\u2019t expect to make any major changes to the APIs. This includes virtually all of the core Privacy Sandbox features, including Topics, Protected Audience, Attribution Reporting, Private Aggregation, Shared Storage and Fenced Frames.\nImage Credits: Google\nIt\u2019s worth noting that for the time being, Privacy Sandbox will run in parallel with third-party cookies in the browser. It won\u2019t be until early 2024 that Google will deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users. After that, the process will speed up and Google will deprecate these cookies for all users by the second half of 2024.\nPreviously, the adtech industry was already able to test its readiness for the eventual third-party cookie deprecation, in part through the Relevance and Measurement origin trial. With these features moving into general availability, Google will end this trial (and revoke the tokens to run experiments) on September 20, 2023.\nFor Chrome users, Google will also now start rolling out its user interface to allow them to manage Privacy Sandbox data in the browser, including ad topics, site-suggested ads and ad measurement data. This rollout will run in parallel with the API releases.\nGoogle will soon make enrollment and attestation a mandatory process for adtech companies that want to access these APIs on Chrome and Android, though they will be able to continue to do some local testing as well.\n\u201cShipping these APIs is another key milestone in the ongoing Privacy Sandbox timeline,\u201d Google notes in today\u2019s announcement. \u201cThis marks the beginning of the transition from sites testing in the origin trial to integrating these APIs in production. We will be keeping you updated as we progress through enabling the APIs, to the opt-in testing with labels in Q4 2023, the 1% third-party cookie deprecation in Q1 2024, heading towards the full third-party cookie phaseout in Q3 2024.\u201d\n\nGoogle starts global tests of Privacy Sandbox ad targeting\n\n",

        "title": "YouTube Premium individual plan now costs $2 more for all subscribers in the US",
        "content": "Just like many other streaming services, YouTube has increased the prices of its Premium plan for individuals in the U.S., from $11.99 per month to $13.99 per month.\nThe price hike follows last year\u2019s price bump in family plans in many countries. In the U.S. the family plan tariff went from $17.99 per month to $22.99 per month. The individual plan change, first spotted by 9to5Google, is live on the YouTube Premium page.\nYouTube confirmed the move to TechCrunch and said the price hike will affect all \u2014 current and new \u2014 subscribers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re updating the price for YouTube Premium and YouTube Music Premium subscribers in the U.S. to continue delivering great service and features. We believe this new price reflects the value of YouTube Premium which allows subscribers to enjoy ad-free YouTube with background and offline play and uninterrupted access to over 100 million songs with the YouTube Music app,\u201d a company spokesperson said.\nThe price for Premium is even higher if you pay through Apple\u2019s in-app purchase system. There\u2019s it\u2019s $18.99/month.\nThe company said that users will have to pay the updated prices from their next billing cycle. It added that folks who subscribed to YouTube Premium five years ago, when the plan was launched, will get three additional months at their current price.\nWith YouTube Premium, Google offers ad-free viewing, the ability to download videos, 1080p streaming of higher quality, the ability to resume videos from where you left off and access to YouTube Music. The company also releases experimental features for Premium subscribers, such as the ability to change playback speed and a lock screen feature to avoid accidental touches.\nGoogle is also hiking the price of the YouTube Music plan from $9.99 per month to $10.99 per month. This follows subscription price raises from Apple Music and Amazon Music, which also offer their streaming at the same price. Spotify\u2019s individual plan still costs $9.99 per month.\nOver the last few months, rival video services such as Apple TV+, Paramount+ and Peacock have announced price hikes. While Netflix raised its prices last year, the company commenced a crackdown on password sharing, making users pay more or add an extra member to their plans.\nYouTube is also trying to push more people toward its premium plans by taking actions like restricting ad-blockers. It also ran an experiment that briefly put 4K streaming behind a paywall.\nLast November, YouTube said that it had more than 80 million subscribers across Music and Premium offerings. With Google\u2019s earnings next week, the company is taking steps to increase paid users.\n",

It also says it can spot when suppliers\u2019 try to send estimated bills rather than final ones.\nThe new feature is on the free tier of Nous membership, currently works with energy bills and will soon be extended to broadband, mobile phone and insurance documents, with alerts delivered via WhatsApp.\nAccording to the company\u2019s own research, two-thirds of people in the U.K. find it difficult to understand their energy bills and only 15% say they read the small print.\nAfter just over 12 months of development in private beta, Nous soon plans to offer a subscription service as its premium product, focusing on clear billing and customer reassurance regarding data privacy. The free product will serve as an onboarding tool and customer acquisition funnel for the premium service. The startup relies on open banking regulations to access consumer spending data.\nGreg Marsh, co-founder and CEO of Nous, told me: \u201cWe knew intellectually AI would be part of the story for this service. It offers automation and scale. What I hadn\u2019t got clear until this year was how powerful it was to unlock customer value. The combination of LLMs, our domain knowledge and our connections with commercial suppliers is very powerful. But AI is front and center of this.\u201d\nHe says that given most people find trawling through their bills boring, utilities and insurance companies can sometimes use that as an opportunity to \u201cbury nasty surprises.\u201d He says generative AI is \u201cperfectly suited to catching this stuff straight away.\u201d\nHe says Nous has thousands of people using the service but he doesn\u2019t want to be in the business of monetizing the data: \u201cWe use it to enhance the user. The typical insurance contract requires 44 pieces of information. We can get almost all of those pieces from your last insurance contract, then can ask you just four extra questions through a chat interaction through WhatsApp.\u201d\nMarsh, a former VC at Index Ventures and the exited founder of onefinestay, says he came up with Nous after struggling to grapple with his household bills while down with COVID-19 during the pandemic and the simultaneous birth of his second child.\nNous has so far raised $10 million in seed funding from investors including Tom Blomfield (co-founder of GoCardless & Monzo), Marc Warner (co-founder & CEO of Faculty.ai), Dan Hegarty (founder & CEO of mortgage company Habito), Eamon Jubbawy (co-founder of Onfido) and Brent Hoberman (founder of Founders Forum). Mosaic Ventures and Chalfen Ventures also participated. Nous says it is a \u201cB-Corp pending\u201d business.\n",

        "title": "TikTok expands research API to Europe and launches ads transparency library",
        "content": "TikTok has finally launched an ads transparency library \u2014 starting with data on ads and other commercial content running in Europe but with plans to expand that.\nAlso today it\u2019s announced expanded access to its research API to Europe.\nBoth moves look intended to help the company comply with incoming requirements under the European Union\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA).\u00a0Back in April, the video-sharing social network was confirmed as one of 19 so-called very large online platforms (VLOPs) under the DSA \u2014 a designation which brings a suite of additional compliance requirements related to algorithmic transparency and accountability.\nTo wit: Article 39 of the pan-EU regulation requires VLOPs whose platforms display ads to offers a searchable database of ads with information, including who paid for the ad, the main targeting parameters and data on views. While Article 40 concerns data access for vetted and other external researchers to further the regulation\u2019s goal of ensuring that systemic risks flowing from major platforms are able to be robustly studied.\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re expanding access to our Research API to Europe and opening up new transparency tools for commercial content,\u201d TikTok wrote in a blog post announcing the launches. \u201cThese tools are designed to enhance transparency about content on our platform and are informed by feedback we\u2019re hearing from researchers and civil society.\u201d\nA TikTok spokesman confirmed the research API is being made available to researchers working across Europe, not only those at institutions inside the EU \u2014 so it\u2019s also open to applications from academics working in the EEA (European Economic Area), Switzerland and the U.K.\nThe social media platform announced it was developing an API for researchers last summer \u2014 when it said\u00a0it would provide select researchers with more transparency about its platform and moderation system by giving access to public and anonymized data about content and activity on the app. An initial version of the Research API was ready for testing\u00a0by members of TikTok\u2019s Content and Safety Advisory Councils in\u00a0November \u2014 before being opened up to academic researchers in the US earlier this year, in February.\nSo far, the free API has seen more than 60 applications from US nonprofit academic researchers on topics including those related to consumer trends, misinformation and mental health, per TikTok.\nThe impact of social media platforms on young people\u2019s lives and well-being continues to be a topic of discussion and concern in mainstream media. But scientists have warned we still don\u2019t have robust data to draw strong conclusions \u2014 hence the push by EU lawmakers to make major platforms open up to outside scrutiny.\nTikTok\u2019s approach for the research API requires researchers to create an account and complete an application which it reviews to ensure its criteria are met before granting access. So it said it expects the first nonprofit academic researchers in Europe to get access \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d.\nTikTok\u2019s criteria for access to the API require regional researchers to have demonstrable academic experience and expertise in the research area specified in the application; no conflicts of interest with respect to using the services;\u00a0a clearly defined research proposal; and to be committed to only using the data for non-commercial purposes.\nAlso today, it said it\u2019s working on being able to grant researchers who are collaborating with others the ability to work together on a shared research project. This incoming collaboration feature, which it says it\u2019s adding in response to feedback from early users, will be called \u201cLab Access\u201d.\n\u201cMore than half the applications we\u2019ve received request collaboration with other researchers, so we\u2019ll soon be allowing up to 10 researchers to work together on a shared research project,\u201d it wrote. \u201cAll researchers will need to have their own TikTok for Developers account and be located in the US or Europe to access our Research API.\n\u201cPrincipal researchers will be able to submit a single application for collaborators from the same university. Projects involving multiple universities will need to submit separate applications for each school.\u201d\nAds transparency at last\nThe ads transparency library, or \u201cCommercial Content Library\u201d as TikTok is billing it, is a newer initiative \u2014 and the launch plugs a long-standing transparency gap for the platform.\nA critical report on TikTok by Mozilla, back in mid 2021, found policy loopholes, lax oversight around influencer marketing and the lack of a public, searchable ads database was making the platform vulnerable to passing off political ads as organic content \u2014 rendering TikTok\u2019s official policy banning political ads pretty meaningless.\nNow anyone can search TikTok ads or other commercial content by country, date and keyword.\nHowever \u2014 big caveat! \u2014 for now only data on commercial stuff running in Europe is available. TikTok said it plans to include data from \u201cmore countries\u201d in the future (but did not specify where or when).\n\u201cThe Commercial Content Library is a searchable database with information about paid ads and ad metadata, such as the advertising creative, dates the ad ran, main parameters used for targeting (e.g. age, gender), number of people who were served the ad, and more,\u201d TikTok noted.\nThe tool also includes information about other content that\u2019s \u201ccommercial in nature and tagged with either a paid partnership label or promotional label, such as content that promotes a brand, product or service but is not a paid ad\u201d \u2014 so TikTok is including influence marketing in the database too (or at least it is if the influencers have correctly tagged their videos).\nA few \u201cPaid partnerships\u201d seen by millions of TikTok users in Spain which are listed under \u201cother commercial content\u201d in TikTok\u2019s database (Screengrab: Natasha Lomas/TechCrunch)\n\u201cWe tested an early version of the Commercial Content Library with researchers and civil society to gather feedback over the last few months before making it more broadly available,\u201d TikTok added. \u201cFrom our tests and input from experts, we\u2019ve added the ability to perform precise searches, included more targeting parameters, and improved data quality \u2014 among other updates.\u201d\nTikTok is also providing access to a Commercial Content API to enable researchers to query the ads database.\n\u201cResearchers will need to create a TikTok Developers account and submit an application to access the Commercial Content API which we review to help prevent malicious actors from misusing this data,\u201d it added.\n\nTikTok begins testing an early version of its platform research API\n\n",

        "title": "Gushwork.ai raises $2M, led by Lightspeed, to outsource business tasks to workforces trained in AI",
        "content": "Gushwork.ai, a global platform that aims to advance business process outsourcing (BPO) using AI and human expertise, has raised $2.1 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Lightspeed. B Capital, Sparrow Capital, Seaborne Capital and Beenext also participated in backing the startup that launched in April this year.\nIn recent years, companies have invested considerable amounts of money in hiring skilled professionals to oversee their operational processes, such as administration, HR, payroll management or customer support. An increasing alternative to in-house hiring is to engage with staffing agencies or BPOs to outsource operations or to use platforms, such as Upwork or Fiverr to find freelancers who can handle process-oriented tasks. However, this has become a significant cost factor due to ongoing inflation. Gushwork.ai strives to address this problem in the market using its AI-powered, cross-border platform.\nThe startup provides a curated marketplace that features offshore workers trained in using various AI applications to help businesses carry out their processes efficiently. It lets entrepreneurs outsource their tedious workflows and focus only on strategically important tasks.\nNayrhit Bhattacharya, co-founder and CEO of Gushwork.ai, calls the process \u201cUberizing the employee workforce,\u201d as businesses can hire talent from different markets for their manually driven operational functions on a part-time basis. He co-founded Gushwork.ai with Adithya Venkatesh (CPO) in January with a usage-based pricing model.\n\u201cBusinesses don\u2019t need to hire full-time,\u201d Bhattacharya told TechCrunch in an interview. \u201cThey can use somebody for a few hours \u2014 three hours this week, 40 hours next week \u2014 and then not use it for another week.\u201d\nAlongside offering part-time access to offshore talent, Gushwork.ai trains and equips its workforce with AI tools to make them fit for many workflows that were previously considered creative and not merely process-oriented to a large extent. These can be generating photorealistic blog designs, converting webinars to blogs, generating images for blog writing, writing blog posts on different topics or even doing search engine optimization. Generative AI tools have enabled large workforces to perform such creative tasks without requiring special skills.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need a 3D graphic designer per se, or you don\u2019t need to spend three months trying to find the right 3D graphic designer or the photorealistic image copy generator on Upwork or Fiverr,\u201d Bhattacharya noted.\nGushwork.ai has trained its AI-augmented workforce to perform tasks, such as lead prospecting, email marketing, ad management, lead engagement on social media platforms, webinar moderation and marketing, social media management, responding to inbound leads, CRM setup, social media analytics data scraping, prospect outreach and ad campaign management, among others. These are all initially aimed at easing sales and marketing operations workflows. However, the startup also plans to expand into more specialized roles in the future.\nWithin the first three months of operation, Gushwork.ai saw more than 50 businesses adopting its platform to delegate more than 200 complex workflows. Bhattacharya told TechCrunch that around 80% of its customers use the platform on an active basis every week, while almost 90% of them use it every month.\nThe startup has its key outbound focus on small and medium businesses and bootstrapped startups in the U.S. and Canada that have a team size of two to 20-30 members. Bhattacharya said that as much as 80% of its current customer base comprises small and medium businesses.\nWhile developed economies are the dominating markets for Gushwork.ai, Bhattacharya said it saw nearly 20% of its customers from India as well. The startup also considers India and the Philippines the initial supply bases for its offshore talent, though it looks to set up its workforce base across different countries over time.\n\u201cThe era of remote work has unlocked a number of new job opportunities and workflows that can be executed from anywhere in the world. This transcends beyond the traditional IT services or BPO industry. Gushwork.ai is leveraging this tailwind of cross-border cost arbitrage and is building a unique platform for businesses to delegate some of their most complex workflows to an elite on-demand offshore workforce trained on AI tools and apps. We are excited to partner with the team as they innovate and revitalize the future of outsourcing with AI,\u201d said Lightspeed partner Rahul Taneja in a prepared statement.\nIn the next few months, Gushwork.ai plans to utilize the fresh funds to enhance quality control and data security and privacy. It also looks to build features to help businesses create and document their complex processes within Gushwork.ai\u2019s platform and use them as large training datasets to automate a list of workflows. Further, it plans to invest some capital in content-led organic market and personal building channels to reach new customers.\nThe startup currently has more than 25 full-time and part-time employees spread across three countries, with Bhattacharya based in Brooklyn and three founding members and co-founder Venkatesh in India\u2019s Bengaluru.\n",

        "content": "Python is the preferred programming language in AI. However, most organizations can\u2019t incorporate their Python developers into legacy data infrastructure. That means they miss out on pulling the benefits of AI into the org. However, there has been a lack of open source Python library for developers designed around AI workflows.\ndltHun (short for data load tool), a Berlin-based startup, thinks it may have the solution. It\u2019s building exactly that open source python library which, it claims, is designed for this new wave of AI.\nThe startup says its library will integrate into existing workflows, including Python workflows where previously data loading did not happen, such as a Google Colab notebook, an AWS Lambda function, an Airflow DAG or GPT-4-assisted docs or GPT-4 development playgrounds.\nThe startup has now raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding from Dig Ventures, founded by Ross Mason who created the Mule Project and founded MuleSoft (MULE:NYSE). Joining the round are AI and enterprise founders from companies such as Hugging Face, Instana, Miro and Matillion.\nCEO Matthaus Krzykowski told me via email: \u201cMost of the GPT-4 apps that are showcased in the media are demoware. Users that try them abandon them quickly. Other AI tooling where VCs recently have been piling on a lot of money (vector databases / frameworks) have a lot of similar challenges.\u201d\nHe says dlt now has a growing community of Python developers and is being \u201cdeployed in production in several scale-up tech companies,\u201d including San Francisco-based software delivery company Harness, which we previously covered.\nIn a statement, Alexander Butler, senior data engineer at Harness, said: \u201cLeveraging dlt has changed our data operations. It has\u2026 accelerated the pace of our DataOps team: we spend less time on the EL (extract and load) and more on the T whilst still being able to deeply customise our extractors as business requirements evolve.\u201d\nJulien Chaumond, CTO/co-founder at Hugging Face and an angel investor at dltHub added: \u201cThe current machine learning revolution has been enabled by the Cambrian explosion of Python open-source tools that have become so accessible that a wide range of practitioners can use them. As a simple-to-use Python library, dlt is the first tool that this new wave of people can use.\u201d\nIn regards to potential competitors, Krzykowski admits that the startup \u201ccompetes with ETL companies such Meltano, Stitch Data, Airbyte and to a lesser degree Fivetran.\u201d\nHowever, he says that \u201cfrom a bigger picture we operate in the space of data warehouse companies such Snowflake, Databricks, Microsoft Fabric who also want to build to bring AI to the enterprise.\u201d\n",
